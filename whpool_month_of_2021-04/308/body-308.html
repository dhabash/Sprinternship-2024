Bless our Navajo people struggling with COVID-19 . Comfort those who have lost loved one. Bless our first responders, provide them protection. Bless our elders, our children and our precious veterans. We humbly ask and mediate that our earthly struggles and suffering is being heard in DC among our elected leaders. And Have a true understanding of our Navajo culture. But spiritually we ask you for strength and humbleness.<br> </div> <div><br> </div> <div> <div> <b><a href="https://www.nativebusinessmag.com/biden-campaign-adds-clara-pratte-navajo-to-lead-engagement-with-tribes/" title="https://www.nativebusinessmag.com/biden-campaign-adds-clara-pratte-navajo-to-lead-engagement-with-tribes/">Clara Pratte</a>, Biden Admin Tribal Engagement Leader (host/emcee) </b></div> <div> <br> </div> <div> Over the last year we have had some very tough times. I think our resolve was tested. But our faith never wavered. For the Navajo people, we are nothing if we are not resilient. And we're so honored to share that with you today, Dr. Biden, the resiliency of the Navajo people where we are, where we were a year from today, to now. And I think this, this pandemic has touched each and every one of us in a very personal way. There's not one of us that has not had some sense of loss over the last year.<br> </div> <div> <br> </div> <div> <b>President Jonathan Nez</b></div> <div> <br> </div> <div> Did you know when when you say the word Joe Biden in Navajo, that's compassion, translated. And when we were doing the campaign, we put that name to Joe Biden, Joe Biden. And that's how a lot of our elders remembered that at the polls. Just thought we'd share that with you today. <br> </div> <div> <br> </div> <div> [Thank you for witnesssing] the magnification of our resilience right here on the grounds of our nation's capitol.<br> </div> <div> <br> </div> <div> We met President Biden and vice president Harris last October. At that time, nominee Biden promised to listen to native people and understood the importance of the government to government relationship.<br> </div> <div> <br> </div> <div> The sacred document that is at the Navajo Nation museum today, Manny showed the First Lady, Dr. Biden. The treaty, the copy that we have, that establishes this nation to nation dialogue that we have with the federal government.</div> <div> <br> </div> <div> The Navajo people came out and delivered the state of Arizona on election day, even in the midst of a terrible pandemic. And I was sharing with the first lady that some precincts even had 60, 70, 80% turnout at the at the polls this past election, and we are very pleased that the Biden Harris administration is keeping their promise by having a seat at the table for the Navajo Nation and other tribes. As we welcome First Lady Biden to the Navajo Nation, we have to remember that we are still in the midst of the covid 19 pandemic. But but we also want to take this opportunity to highlight the Navajo Nation success in pushing back on the virus and the success we are having with the vaccination. Each day we are vaccinating more of our people. <br> </div> <div> <br> </div> <div> Our Navajo people have done a wonderful job adhering to the public health orders put forth by our health care experts and our first responders. They deserve a big, big round of applause and we see many of them here today. <br> </div> <div> <br> </div> <div> We as leaders of the Navajo Nation listened to our public health experts. And we relied on the data and the facts to help mitigate the pandemic. And sometimes we wish that other leaders throughout the country would do the same. With the Biden Harris administration, we've received much needed support through the Indian Health Service. And we are proud to report that close to 95,000 residents have been fully vaccinated. Give him a round of applause. That's two doses, which represents well over half of the adult population here on the Navajo Nation as we continue to emerge from the pandemic, we also remember all the lives lost to COVID-19. We've lost 1263. Danette lives to the virus since the start of the pandemic. It's heartbreaking to speak with families who have lost mothers, fathers, grandparents, brothers and sisters. And we are very thankful that first lady Biden is making time to speak with local residents, educators and health care workers. While she is here. I believe your visit will help to ensure and inspire our people even more The First Lady of the United States with us here on our ancestral home is historic and uplifting. As we visit with our Navajo people tomorrow, I want you to see firsthand the strength, the determination, the hope and resilience in the hearts of our people despite all of the challenges and setbacks. The Navajo people remain strong and overcoming the pandemic together and look forward to working with the Biden Harris administration to Build back better in the years to come. Not only to assist our people and empower them to create a brighter future for generations to come.<br> </div> <div> <br> </div> <div> And we look forward to partnering with this administration in its plans to invest in infrastructure, especially here where we need that investment for roads, broadband, water and electricity. As we move forward, we look forward to our time together. And we want you to know that there is always an open invitation from the Navajo Nation to you, President Biden, and vice president Harris cadore.<br> </div> <div> <br> </div> <div> God bless you, God bless United States of America. And God bless the great, Navajo Nation.<br> </div> <div> <br> </div> <div> <b>Vice President Myron Lizer</b></div> <div> <br> </div> <div> This evening we gather in a significant and sacred place. look all around you.<br> </div> <div> Navajo nation's veterans memorial park, where we honor and recognize our Navajo veterans and Navajo Code Talkers. throughout many decades, our past tribal warriors have met in this very spot to discuss and plan strategies to improve the livelihood of the people of the great Navajo Nation.<br> </div> <div> <br> </div> <div> Today we envision a new beginning of inter governmental collaboration and understanding. Over the past years, the milestones were accomplished through federal partnership. And today, we need to build upon those steps for a better future for children. Our priorities reflect the voices of the people. The Navajo business owners, we heard about them just a few minutes ago at the museum Our farmers or ranchers, our students and parents and our elders. Our people have endured so much harsh conditions over the time and situations, and it is time to relieve some of that burden and the setbacks that they have experienced. In addition, we also need to support in the areas of economic development, and dual taxation constraints, preservation and conservation of Navajo land, the need for financial literacy and economic opportunities. As leaders, we envision a great and prosperous future for our children. Scripture says that a man is truly blessed when he leaves an inheritance for his children and his children's children. And as we work here, and we go forward together, we look for those opportunities. And most importantly, they would continue to be a part of the American dream. President Nez said very eloquently build back better. But on Indian country, I've coined it the great catch up, we need to catch up with the times. Indian country has been left behind. And this is the opportunity that we have before us. With this administration, we hope that you will help us leave no stone unturned in that great advancement.</div> <div> <br> </div> <div>  <div> <b><a href="https://www.nativebusinessmag.com/biden-campaign-adds-clara-pratte-navajo-to-lead-engagement-with-tribes/" title="https://www.nativebusinessmag.com/biden-campaign-adds-clara-pratte-navajo-to-lead-engagement-with-tribes/">Clara Pratte</a>, Biden Admin Tribal Engagement Leader (host/emcee) </b></div> </div> <div> <br> </div> <div> And Dr. Biden, I think has been probably you‘be probably visited Navajo Nation now at least three times. That has to be a record somewhere somehow. So thank you.<br> </div> <div> Next we need to get a hogan for her, a permanent Hogan so she has a place to come home to. Her own Airbnb Hogan.<br> </div> <div> <br> </div> <div> Dr. Biden has not shied away from meeting with the with native people, particularly with the Navajo Nation, she visited and delivered a commencement address at Navajo Technical University came and visited the cancer center and now here to visit with our schools and with our education and with our education center in our hospitals.<br> </div> <div> <br> </div> <div> It’s truly a breath of fresh air. And knowing the commitment that the Biden Harris administration has to Indian country is, is profound and it's deeply deeply moving. As someone who's worked in this field for a long time, I can tell you, this is not the norm, but it should be the norm. We should expect this and we should have that partnership at the other side of our federal table. So we're just just so delighted and honored.<br> </div> <div> <br> </div> <div> But the distances here are vast, Dr. Biden, and I'm grateful that you're here to see again firsthand the need for infrastructure and development and all of these important things that we need, they all go hand in hand. Nothing exists in a vacuum. <br> </div> <div> <br> </div> <div> <b>Navajo Council Speaker Seth Damon</b></div> <div> <br> </div> <div> It's a beautiful evening, even though we might have to get bundled up a little bit. But I think this is one of those evenings that Dr. Jill Biden will never forget, especially in this beautiful setting that we are here in our great capital of the great Navajo Nation. As you can see the beautiful Window Rock behind us, the vast landscape that you drove through and the many times that you've been here, Dr. Jill Biden, thank you from the bottom of my heart and my family's heart, and from the nation, most importantly, for your visit again. It must be a record for you to be here more than one time, two times. And now it's three times. I don't think that there's ever been any dignitary of that magnitude that has come here as often as you have. That takes great honor to know that you have great interest in the Navajo people, the Navajo culture, and understanding what we need in order to build ourselves to build up as honorable Vice President lizer said into a new environment, new growth and building ourselves up into this modern world, as we know, as connected to the United States of America. <br> </div> <div> <br> </div> <div> But what I can say is that the reason why I think that you really, really keep coming back to the nation, is because you want to learn more from our Navajo people. And you want to take that back to the White House.<br> </div> <div> <br> </div> <div> It is something that was really a whole heart setting to know that we have beautiful understanding leadership in our woman nation.<br> </div> <div> <br> </div> <div> One of the most monumental powers, that the reason why the Navajo Nation is still here is because of the woman nation. And that is so you heard it today. You're a fierce warrior. And you'll take that back with you. And I think that's something that's you're going to be admirable to understand when you advocate for services and healthcare, advocate for services in education, advocate for services and for veterans needs. <br> </div> <div> <br> </div> <div> We have not only a leader in the White House, but a friend but most importantly, a protector of our woman nation. And I think that's set in stone. And that's something that we can really look forward and look at a promise of today's tomorrow for my granddaughter, and her next seven generations.<br> </div> </div> <div><br> </div> <div> <div>Sent from my iPhone</div> <div>Jada Yuan</div> <div>Political Features Writer, <i>The Washington Post</i></div> <div>▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊</div> <div>C: ▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊</div> <div>Twitter: @jadabird</div> <div>IG: @alphajada</div> </div> </div> </div>
