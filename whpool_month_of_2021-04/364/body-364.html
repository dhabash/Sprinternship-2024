  <div>Fuller quotes from the VP:</div> <div><br> </div> <div>"Most people don't want to leave home. They don't want to leave their grandparents, they don't want to leave the culture."</div> <div><br> </div> <div>"So the question has to be 'Why do people leave home?' And often it is the case that people leave home when they don't want to either because they are fleeing sometimes, or because they are unable to satisfy their basic needs and the needs of taking care of their family. Because the resources and opportunities are not there. And so they have to go elsewhere.​"</div> <div><br> </div> <div>"I don't need to tell this group of experts that this is an issue that has been a long standing issue, it is complex. If it were easy, it would have been solved a long time ago." <div><br> </div> <div>"We also know that the work that we can do there together, and the potential for the work that we can do together, will not be accomplished overnight."<br> </div> </div> <div><br> </div> <div>"I've asked the leaders of major philanthropic organizations — not only nationally but globally — I've asked you to come together so I can learn from you. So I can hear from you. Many of you have been investing for years, like I said, in the region. I want to hear from you to know what works, what has worked, what has not worked. So that will help inform our strategy going forward."<br> </div> <div><br> </div> <div> <div>"And the bottom line is that this initiative, from my perspective, must be effective and relevant to the underlying issue, which is addressing the acute and the root causes of migration away from that region."</div> <div><br> </div> <div>That's it from me — thanks all!
