This is 88% of all adults and 88% of all children in the state.</li><li> Additional relief of up to $1,600 per child through the Child Tax Credit to the families of 2,274,000 children, lifting 171,000 children out of poverty.</li><li> Additional relief of up to nearly $1,000 through the Earned Income Tax Credit to 572,000 childless workers.</li><li> Marketplace health insurance premiums that are $1,406 lower per month for a 60-year old couple earning $75,000 per year. </li></ul> <p> <b><u>The Need for the American Jobs Plan in Georgia</u></b></p> <p> <a>Georgia’s infrastructure received a C+ grade on its Infrastructure Report Card. The American Jobs Plan (AJP) will make historic investments in our nation’s infrastructure:</a></p> <ul> <li> <b>Roads and bridges:</b> In Georgia there are 374 bridges and over 2,260 miles of highway in poor condition. Since 2011, commute times have increased by 10.8% and on average, each driver pays $375 per year in costs due to driving on roads in need of repair. The AJP will devote more than $600 billion to transportation infrastructure, including $115 billion for repairing roads and bridges.</li><li> <b>Public Transportation</b>: Georgians who take public transportation spend an extra 74.1% of their time commuting and non-White households are 3.9 times more likely to commute via public transportation. The AJP will modernize public transit with an $85 billion investment.</li><li> <b>Resilient Infrastructure</b>: From 2010 to 2020, Georgia has experienced 46 extreme weather events, costing the state up to $20 billion in damages. The AJP invests $50 billion to improve the resiliency of our infrastructure and support communities’ recovery. </li><li> <b>Drinking Water</b>: Over the next 20 years, Georgia’s drinking water infrastructure will require $12.5 billion in additional funding. The AJP includes a $111 billion investment to ensure safe drinking water. </li><li> <b>Housing</b>: In part due to a lack of available and affordable housing, 654,000 renters in Georgia are rent burdened, meaning they spend more than 30% of their income on rent. The AJP invests over $200 billion to increase housing supply and support affordable housing. </li><li> <b>Broadband</b>: 10% of Georgians live in areas where there is no broadband infrastructure that provides minimally acceptable speeds. 15% of Georgia households do not have an internet subscription. The AJP will invest $100 billion to bring universal, reliable, high-speed, and affordable coverage to every family in America.</li><li> <b>Caregiving</b>: Across the country, hundreds of thousands of older adults and people with disabilities need home and community-based services. The AJP will invest $400 billion to help more people access care and improve the quality of caregiving jobs. </li><li> <b>Child Care</b>: In Georgia, 44% of residents live in a childcare desert. The AJP will modernize our nation’s schools and early learning facilities and build new ones in neighborhoods across Georgia.</li><li> <b>Manufacturing</b>: Manufacturers account for more than 10% of total output in Georgia, employing 411,000 workers, or 8.9% of the state’s workforce. The AJP will invest $300 billion to retool and revitalize American manufacturers. </li><li> <b>Home energy</b>: In Georgia, an average low-income family spends 10-12% of their income on energy costs forcing tough choices between paying energy bills and buying food or other essentials. The AJP will support upgrades to make low-income homes more energy efficient.</li><li> <b>Clean energy jobs</b>: As of 2019, there were 83,806 Georgians working in clean energy, and the AJP invests in creating more well- paying union jobs advancing clean energy production by extending and expanding tax credits for clean energy generation, carbon capture and sequestration, and clean energy manufacturing.</li><li> <b>Veterans Health</b>: Georgia is home to over 697,127 veterans (12.7% are women and 38% are 65+). The AJP invests $18 billion to improve the infrastructure of VA health care facilities.</li></ul> <p> <b><u>The Need for the American Families Plan:</u></b></p> <p> The AFP will directly invest in Georgians to strengthen our schools, expand access to good paying jobs, and support our workers to once again build a middle-class that carries our nation forward. </p> <ul> <li> <b>Higher Education: </b>The average cost of a 2-year degree in Georgia is almost $4,100 per year. High costs are partly why just 61% of students in Georgia are able to complete a postsecondary degree within 6 years of enrolling. The AFP will <a>provide at least two years of free community college to all students, including DREAMers. It will also increase the maximum Pell Grant awards by $1,400 to support the 220,000 students in Georgia who rely on Pell. In addition, the AFP will support Georgia’s 38 Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), Tribal Colleges and Universities (TCUs), and Minority-Serving Institutions (MSIs)</a>.</li><li> <b>Universal Pre-school: </b>Only 30% of the 296,000 3- and 4-year-olds in Georgia have access to publicly-funded pre-school. The AFP will <a>provide access to free, high-quality pre-school to all 3- and 4-year-olds in Georgia</a>. In addition, the AFP will <a>ensure that all employees in funded pre-school programs are paid a $15 minimum wage</a>.</li><li> <b>Investing in teachers: </b>Having teachers reflect the communities they serve is critical to student performance and in Georgia just 31% of teachers are teachers of color, while students of color make up 61% of the student population. The AFP will invest $9 billion to address teacher shortages, improve teacher preparation, recruit and develop more teachers of color.</li><li> <b>Child nutrition: </b>14% of children in Georgia live in food insecure households and 31% are obese. The AFP will expand access to free school meals to an additional 159,000 students and provide 1.1 million students ways to purchase food during summer.</li><li> <b>Child care: </b>The average annual cost of childcare for a toddler or infant in Georgia is over $8,100, meaning the average family spends 9% of their income on child care every year. The lack of affordable childcare also makes it more difficult for women to work, contributing to the 19% gap in workforce participation between mothers and fathers. The AFP <a>will enable low and middle-income families to pay no more than 7% of their income on high-quality child care</a>. </li><li> <b>Paid leave: </b>More than 30 million workers in 41 states, including Georgia, lack access to paid sick leave. The AFP will create a national, comprehensive paid family and medical leave program.</li><li> <b>Health care:</b> The ARP provides two years of lower health insurance premiums for those who buy coverage on their own; the AFP will make those premium reductions permanent. In Georgia, that means 193,000 uninsured people will gain coverage and 262,000 will save hundreds of dollars per year on their premiums. The average family in Georgia will save $50 per person per month on health coverage. </li><li> <a><b>Tax cuts for families and workers: </b></a> <ul> <li>The AFP will extend through 2025 the Child Tax Credit increases of $3,000 per child 6-years-old and above and $3,600 per child under 6 that were enacted in the ARP. It will make the credit fully refundable so that low-income families receive the same credit as middle-income families. This extension will benefit more than 91% of children in Georgia, more than 1.3 million of whom are children of color, and is estimated to lift 171,000 children out of poverty in the state.</li><li>To support families with childcare needs, the AFP will provide a permanent increase to the temporary Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit expansion enacted in the ARP. Families will get back as a tax credit as much as half of their spending on child care for children under age 13.</li><li>The American Families Plan will also make the Earned Income Tax Credit Expansion for childless workers permanent to support low-wage workers. This will benefit 569,000 workers in Georgia, many of whom are essential workers and 289,000 of whom are people of color.</li></ul> </li></ul> <p> <b><u>Federal Support for </u></b><b><u>Georgia</u></b><b><u> Vaccinations</u></b></p> <p> <b>Pharmacies: </b>As of April 27, through the federal program, the Biden-Harris Administration has made vaccines available in nearly 1,200 pharmacies to date, with over 600 receiving deliveries in the past week. Participating retail pharmacies are primarily Walgreens, Kroger, CVS, and Walmart locations.</p> <p> <b>Community Health Centers: </b>The Biden-Harris Administration has invited all 35 health centers in Georgia to receive direct vaccine allocations, spanning 26 cities. Combined, the centers have sites at over 250 different care delivery locations across the state. As of April 27, 16,970 doses have been delivered to Community Health Centers in Georgia through the federal vaccinations program.</p> <p> <b>Federal Funding:</b> As of April 26, the Biden-Harris Administration has provided over $116 million to the state to support vaccination operations. There are 9 community vaccination centers operational in the state, including one FEMA pilot CVC at the Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta. 270 federal personnel are currently deployed to the state to support vaccination efforts, in addition to more than 1,000 federally-funded National Guard members supporting the state’s COVID-19 response.</p> <div>Get <a href="https://aka.ms/o0ukef"> Outlook for iOS</a></div> </div> </div> <br> <p><b>Disclaimer</b></p> <p>This e-mail and any attached files are intended for the named addressee only.
