  <div> <div> <div>The White House sent the following to pooler.</div> <div><br> </div> <div> <p> <b>Excerpts from President Biden’s Remarks on Afghanistan As Prepared for Delivery</b></p> <p> We cannot continue the cycle of extending or expanding our military presence in Afghanistan hoping to create the ideal conditions for our withdrawal, expecting a different result.</p> <p> I am now the fourth American president to preside over an American troop presence in Afghanistan. Two Republicans. Two Democrats.</p> <p> I will not pass this responsibility to a fifth.</p> <p> After consulting closely with our Allies and partners, with our military leaders and intelligence professionals, with our diplomats and development experts, and with Congress and the Vice President, I have concluded that:</p> <p> It is time to end America’s longest war. It is time for American troops to come home.</p> <p> ---</p> <p> While we will not stay involved in Afghanistan militarily, our diplomatic and humanitarian work will continue.</p> <p> We will continue to support the Government of Afghanistan.</p> <p> We will keep providing assistance to the Afghan National Defense and Security Forces. Along with our partners, we are training and equipping nearly 300,000 personnel. And they continue to fight valiantly on behalf of their country and defend the Afghan people, at great cost.</p> <p> We will support peace talks between the Government of Afghanistan and the Taliban, facilitated by the United Nations.</p> <p> ---</p> <p> We went to Afghanistan because of a horrific attack that happened 20 years ago.</p> <p> That cannot explain why we should remain there in 2021.</p> <p> Rather than return to war with the Taliban, we have to focus on the challenges that will determine our standing and reach today and into the years to come.</p> <br> </div> <div><br> </div> <div> <div> Courtney Rozen</div> <div> White House Reporter</div> <div> Bloomberg Government</div> <div> ▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊</div> <div> ▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊</div> </div> </div> </div>
