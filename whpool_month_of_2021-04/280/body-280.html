 <p> Per the translator in the room, here is an English transcript of PM Suga remarks<br><br> <br><br> Thank you very much. Thank you for accepting me as the first foreign leader under your presidency. My deepest gratitude to you. <br><br>And yesterday, there was a shooting in Indianapolis, so I heard, and causing much casualty. I would like to express my condolences to the victims, and my sympathies to the families. Innocent citizens must not be exposed to any such violence. <br><br> Freedom, democracy, human rights, and the rule of law, are the universal values that link our alliance that is prevalent in the Indo-Pacific, and this is the very foundation of prosperity and stability of the region and the globe.<br><br> And the importance of such values has heightened to unprecedented level. And upon my visit to the United States I wish to reaffirm the new and tight bond between us, and in order to realize a free and open Indo-Pacific, there are many common challenges, as well as emerging global issues, including COVID-19 and climate change.<br><br> I wish to spend time with you to again confirm the close ties between our two countries and thank you again for accepting us. <br><br> Best regards,  <br><br> Taka Abe <br><br>****************************<br> Takaaki Abe<br> Deputy Bureau Chief<br> Nippon Television <br> Washington DC News Bureau<br>  ▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊ (Cell) <br>▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊ (E-mail)  </p>
