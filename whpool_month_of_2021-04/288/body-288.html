There is no question that this violence must end and we are thinking of the families that lost their loved ones. The President will speak later about the case.” </p> <p> Turning to PM Suga she said: </p> <p> “It is now my great pleasure to welcome the Prime Minister of Japan and to thank him for this visit which is the first visit to the United States of a world leader since we came into office. The President and I are very excited about the conversations we will have with the prime minister today. As you know, Mr Prime Minister, you and I met just about a month ago during the Quad summit which was a meeting with the United States with our allies Japan, with Australia and with India where we had extensive conversations about the collaborations and the friendship around some of the biggest challenges facing our world.” </p> <p> “It is also a personal point of privilege for me to spend this time with you. As you know I come from California where we have a very strong and vibrant Japanese community who has made great contributions not only to the state but to the country.” </p> <p> <i>{At this point, a plane flew overhead, so difficult to hear} </i></p> <p> She noted “our mutual commitment to the Indo Pacific” and “importance of peace and prosperity in that region of the world.”  </p> <p> Speaking through a translator, PM Suga said: “I would like to first of all express my sincere gratitude for inviting me as the first foreign guest in Washington despite the covid 19 pandemic since the inauguration of the Biden administration. I’m also very delighted to have the opportunity to meet with you vice-president Harris face to face today and have wonderful conversations. I am very much looking forward to it.” </p> <p> “Japan highly praises and appreciates that the Biden- Harris administration puts high importance on cooperating with its allies and partners. There is no other time than today that the  Japan-US alliance needs to be strong. This is an alliance that is connected by universal values, such as freedom, democracy and the rule of law.” </p> <p> “Today I very much look forward to discussing you with Vice-President Harris as well as with President Biden later on regarding important challenges, a wide range of challenges, that both Japan and the United States face and reconfirm the bond of our alliance.” </p> <p> VP Harris replied: “Thank you very much, I look forward to our conversation.” </p> <p> <p>They exited the balcony at 11.17 am and returned to the ceremonial office room for the bilat meeting.</p></p> <p> <p><b>Participants in the meeting: </b></p></p> <p> <b>US Side</b></p> <p> T.H.
