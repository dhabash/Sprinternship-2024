 <p> <br> Emhoff received applause from a room of roughly 50 people, including volunteers, officials and community members getting vaccines, after Emhoff praised the visitors for getting their vaccines. He then went to an empty bar area in the basement, where Oregon Gov. Kate Brown and White Bird Executive Director Chris Hecht discussed the importance of equity and addressing racial disparities when it comes to impacts of COVID-19.<br> <br> “We know our communities of color have been disproportionately impacted, and we have to do everything we can to put justice and equity at the center of our work,” Brown said. <br> <br> Brown also applauded the new presidential administration for its work so far on response to the pandemic, “making sure policy is based both in science and data.”<br> <br> Emhoff thanked the volunteers and the nurse who let him observe as she administered the vaccine, and he noted the importance of having local groups like White Bird working with the state to help administer vaccines.<br> <br> “I love to see these partnerships between the state and local officials and communities,” he said. “It’s a nice way to get the word out and reach communities. You really see things that were bad have been made so much work during the pandemic.”<br> <br> He added that the lessons learned by communities during the pandemic are a blueprint for the future, saying that he hopes new partnerships continue after the pandemic has ended. <br> <br> Emhoff commented on how he is devoted to fixing issues with equity as he tours communities and brings information back to Vice President Kamala Harris. <br> <br> “I come to it as a longtime lawyer driven by passion for justice, fight bullies, fight unfairness,” he said. “This package between the American Rescue Plan and the new jobs plan are going to address that in a way that’s fair and will help all Americans.”<br> <br> There were also leaders of several local social services on hand to provide comments. <br> <br> Hecht said he is confident the new administration will work to fix long-lasting health disparities in the country. <br> <br> “The administration is focused on ameliorating disparities in health and health care that for far too long have been part and parcel for systemic racism,” Hecht said.<br> <br> Representatives from other groups were on hand to discuss their response to the pandemic. Oregon Rep. Peter DeFazio, who accompanied Emhoff and Brown on the tour, took time to say that President Joe Biden’s $2.3 trillion infrastructure plan has a “heavy emphasis on rewriting wrongs from the past in terms of inequity.”<br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> </p>
