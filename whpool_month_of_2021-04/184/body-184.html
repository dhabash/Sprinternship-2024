She's standing in front of a handmade sign with colorfully painted children's handprints and the words, "Birmingham, AL Welcomes Dr. Biden" </div><div><br></div><div>FLOTUS is speaking to roughly 40 people seated on folding chairs inside, spaced in a socially distant manner. Those in the audience included elected officials, stakeholders and members of the community. </div><div><br></div><div>Former Sen. Doug Jones and his wife walked in halfway through Rep. Sewell's remarks. </div><div><br></div><div>Like the learning center, the YWCA runs a Head Start program. (The president's stimulus package included $1 billion for these programs nationwide). </div><div><br></div><div>Ahead of the First Lady, Mayor Randall Woodfin spoke after brief remarks from the YWCA's CEO. "When you think about what exists here in Birmingham, not just from numbers standpoint but from the families standpoint, it is incumbent among all of us to fight childhood poverty," he said, praising the stimulus bill for "taking a stab at childhood poverty." </div><div><br></div><div>Rep. Sewell spoke next, declaring multiple times that she was the only member from the Alabama delegation to vote in favor of the American Rescue Plan. "It was Congressional Democrats who stood up for all Americans," she said. "I'm so glad the First Lady came to Alabama to tell us that help is here," the congresswoman later added.</div><div><br></div><div>Huntley spoke about the need for ‘moving the needle’ because, “I was one of those kids that the needle was really for.” She talked about staying in foster homes, dealing with sexual abuse from family members and being the daughter of drug dealers. When mentioning the importance of teachers in her life, Huntley looked back at the First Lady, who cocked her head and smiled behind her mask.</div><div><br></div><div>She brought the book that she wrote, "More Than a Bird," as a gift for the First Lady. </div><div><br></div><div>FLOTUS is speaking now at 12:26pm CST.
