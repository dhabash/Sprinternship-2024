To serve as a surgeon, in my role, I'm charged with looking out for the health and well being of each and every American. I consider this to be as a sacred responsibility, particularly in this great moment. When we're living through a once in a century. I knew we're here because we all know that COVID-19 has caused tremendous suffering for millions of Americans, many of us have lost family members to this virus. I myself have lost seven, including my uncle Roman earlier this year. Many of us have also felt what it's like to be worried about your loved ones getting killed, especially family members of ours who are elderly, or who might work on the frontlines. And over this past year. My father and my sister went to work in their medical practice. I couldn't help but hear that this was the day that they were going to be exposed to the virus. And during the academic. People have also lost many other jobs, the chance to go to school, the possibility of holding back on the fact that this pandemic is also affected. Some people are more than others. It's also underscored that profound racial and geographic disparities in health, that have long plagued our nation. But despite the heavy toll of COVID as exactly this pandemic has also reminded us of a fundamental truth that we need each other and our happiness and our survival depends on our connection to one another, and our community. And during this past year, even as COVID separated as physically. So many people stepped up to help one another, delivering food to neighbors who were too worried to go to the grocery store, Checking in on friends who are having a hard time putting their own lives at risk, provide medical care and hospitals to get grocery stores open, and to keep our neighborhoods safe. That spirit of community is what makes our country great. And it is what we need now more than as far as we seek the brand is pandemics, and we're all here today because all of you have to greet the founding members of the COVID-19 community in nationwide grassroots network of leaders who are stepping up to protect your communities, and to get our, our goal is to help our communities get vaccinated, and by doing so to stop this spread. Now I know that we've made great progress on the vaccination front. And even though nearly 100 million Americans have already received at least one shot, there are still millions of Americans are not protected against the virus. Your leadership has the power to change them collectively you can reach out to millions of people with the facts about COVID and a COVID vaccine. And this is so important because hearing the facts from trusted sources. This will help people make good decisions about their health. And that's why I firmly believe that your involvement will stabilize. And it's why all of us are so grateful to you for being easy for you. As we begin our conversation today. And as we embark on this work together. I'm also reminded that this initiative is made possible by the hard working men in the administration, we're committed to addressing COVID With the power of science, and compassion and partnership that commitment starts at the very tough. Having champions in the White House with public health is absolutely essential. And that is why I'm so honored to introduce one of our nation's most important leaders. One who is broken barriers, and lifted up communities, a leader who is kind, and strong, and who is inspired millions of people, including myself, and a daughter who took the climb or covered it in the very first time they saw her.</div>
