 <p> Below you’ll find longer quotes from a portion of the gaggle. The Air Force One engine noise made it difficult to hear, so as always check against the official White House transcript. Snaps to co-pooler Eli Stokols for help with transcription duty.<br> <br> PROTESTERS: <br> “Well when they found out I agreed with them, they finally stopped. Because I have been opposed to funding private prisons and that's what they were talking about. And I think they were just very emotionally excited. That's why I stopped and let them go on a little bit and then, when I found out they wanted me to do it immediately like I could sign a paper and make it happen.” <br> <br> Q: You said you wanted five more days - that's not going to be enough is it? <br> <br> “No I was teasing them” .. [inaudible]<br> <br> CAPITO CALL: <br> “We had a good conversation.”<br> <br> “They're off next week, the Senate. I said if you wanted to come next week that's fine, if you want to wait and have our staff talk some more.”<br> <br> “She seemed very serious and very positive about wanting to do something about it.” <br> <br> “Let's decide on infrastructure what they say is infrastructure ... what they are prepared to consider as far as what constitutes it ... and then we can figure out how to pay for it. <br> I think she's serious. Like last time they come in with one fourth or one fifth of what I'm asking and say that's our final offer ... and then we have to go ... [trails off].” <br> <br> GUNS: <br> “It's time for the Congress to stand up ... I'm going to continue to make the case to the American people .. and by the way a significant portion of gun owners and NRA members support eliminating the assault - who the hell needs 100 rounds? The vast majority of the American people are getting fed up with it and I think eventually that's going to break the back of the opposition.” <br> <br> “But look there's a lot on the plate.”<br> <br> “There's a lot going on and it's only been 101 days.” <br> <br> <br> <b>Nikki Schwab</b><br> Senior U.S. Political Reporter<br> Washington, D.C.<br>  <img alt="Description: Description: Description: Description: pastedGraphic.pdf" height="42" src="attachments/image001.png"> <b>MailOnline </b><b>| London | New York | Hollywood | Washington</b> <br><br>T: ▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊<br> E: ▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊<br> <br> <br>  <b>Disclaimer</b><br> This e-mail and any attached files are intended for the named addressee only.
