  <div> <div> <div>Motorcade pulled off interstate for a break at a Flying J truck stop at 4:01pm. The First Lady went inside with us, no one seemed to recognize her. She inquired about the snacks a member of the press bought. She is wearing an all-navy-blue skirt suit with a matching face mask. The Flying J sold many things, including Pro Bass Fishing gear (according to a sign). </div> <div><br> </div> <div>Back on road 4:13pm. </div> <div><br> </div> <div> <div>Sent from my iPhone</div> <div>Jada Yuan</div> <div>Political Features Writer, <i>The Washington Post</i></div> <div>▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊</div> <div>C: ▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊</div> <div>Twitter: @jadabird</div> <div>IG: @alphajada</div> </div> </div> </div>
