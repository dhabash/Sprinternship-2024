  <div> <div> <div> <div>During meal service on the trip back, a flight attendant with short black hair - wearing a black pants suit, black face mask and a name badge reading Jasmine - walked through the staff, Secret Service and press cabins passing out Dove ice cream bars. </div> <div> <div><br> </div> <div>About five minutes after she made her way through, Anthony Bernal and Michael LaRosa came back to the press cabin laughing. </div> <div><br> </div> <div>Then “Jasmine” reappeared in the press section, now sans wig, revealing herself to be Dr. Jill Biden. </div> <div><br> </div> <div>“April Fool’s,” FLOTUS said. </div> <div><br> </div> <div>Pool was indeed totally fooled but takes comfort in the fact that none of FLOTUS’ staff recognized Dr. Biden in disguise either. Bernal and LaRosa reassured the pool they were just as surprised when “Jasmine” revealed her true identity to them. </div> <div><br> </div> <div>The pool laughed. FLOTUS, laughing and visibly pleased with her prank, returned to her cabin. </div> <div><br> </div> <div>The ice cream bars - vanilla with a hard chocolate coating - were delicious. </div> </div> <br> <div> <b>*******************************</b><br> <b>Emily Goodin</b><br> Senior U.S. Political Reporter, DailyMail.com<br> M: ▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊<br> T: https://Twitter.com/emilylgoodin<br> <br> <br> </div> </div> </div> </div> <br> <p><b>Disclaimer</b></p> <p>This e-mail and any attached files are intended for the named addressee only.
