  <div> <div> <div> <div>Entered vaccine center 2:13pm. </div> <div><br> </div> <div>Exited at 2:37pm. It was fast! </div> <div><br> </div> <div>Small group of workers were in parking lot filming arrival on cell phone including some in scrubs. They do the vaccines in 30 minute increments. </div> </div> <div><br> </div> <div>We are in a carpeted room. Three vaccination spots are set up at the front of the room separated by mint green fabric dividers in metal frames. Each has an administrator, standing, in face mask and goggles and a patient sitting in a chair. Other people who had already received the vaccine were sitting socially distanced at tables facing the other direction. I think this is a break room. There’s a demo kitchen (clear signs posted that it is not for residential use) with a fridge and stove to the left of the vaccination pods.</div> <div><br> </div> <div>FLOTUS and Gov. Lujan Grisham met with 3 nurses &amp; nurse practitioners who were administering and 3 patients. </div> <div><br> </div> <div>“Hi! How are you?” said Dr. Biden, waving. </div> <div>Gov. Lujan Grisham waved vigorously. </div> <div><br> </div> <div>BEST PARTS:</div> <div><br> </div> <div>To first woman, in a blue shirt, getting vaccinated by a nurse in dark blue scrubs. (Could not get name of woman but asking press secretary for it.) </div> <div><br> </div> <div>FLOTUS: "So I've had this shot and it doesn't hurt. I promise. Normally I’m scared of them!" Everyone laughed. "I have to say, it’s, like, so fast! Are you a little scared?"</div> <div><br> </div> <div>Woman said she was scared. </div> <div><br> </div> <div> <div>FLOTUS: Do you want me to come stand with you? I'll stay with her." She stood by her. "I can't look either. Look at me. It doesn't hurt. Really. It's mostly in your head." </div> <div>The woman looked at her the whole time and then the shot was over. Everyone applauded. </div> <div><br> </div> </div> <div><br> </div> <div>To the next woman, FLOTUS came over. Woman's name is Vivana Galvez, works in patient registration. </div> <div><br> </div> <div>FLOTUS: "All right! Can I crash? You have to take off your jacket. So why did you decide to come? You felt a duty? Did you have any hesitation?"</div> <div> <div> <br> </div> <div> Viviana: "I did was hesitant a little bit. I mean, I didn't know what was going in my body. And I'm doing them for the community, my family...."</div> <div> <br> </div> <div> FLOTUS: "Right, that's what we want for you." <br> </div> <div> <br> </div> <div> Viviana: "And for myself. Let's get those numbers going down guy. No more lives to lose." </div> <div> <br> </div> <div> She looked right at FLOTUS who was looking down and then the shot was over. They elbow bumped at the end. MLG got in on the elbow bumping. </div> <div> <br> </div> <div> "Tell all your friends to come," said MLG. </div> <div> <br> </div> <div> "Yeah, bring your friends back and tell them how easy it was," said FLOTUS. </div> <div> <br> </div> <div> Viviana told the cameras, "Muy facil, todos vengan a First Choice para sus vaccinos." (please double check) <br> </div> <div> <br> </div> Then FLOTUS handed out buttons and Gov. Lujan Grisham handed out stickers to the people who'd been vaccinated. <br> </div> <div><br> </div> <div>"Thank you from the bottom of my heart," said MLG a few times. </div> <div><br> </div> <div>LINK TO IMPERFECT TRANSCRIPT AND AUDIO HERE: <a href="https://otter.ai/u/zIYhHWCFOYaA6Cl1LckVblMb57I" id="LPlnk">https://otter.ai/u/zIYhHWCFOYaA6Cl1LckVblMb57I</a></div> <div><br> </div> <div>Full transcript in a minute. </div> <div><br> </div> <div> <div>Note: for conversations on the tarmac, the CNN pool feed may have sound.
