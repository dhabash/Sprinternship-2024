So many people have lost jobs and need that kind of help for the first time. So many are frontline workers, showing up every day to keep food on our tables, while their own cupboards are empty at home. </p> <p>And so, so many are moms and dads. </p> <p>Since the start of the pandemic, I’ve heard the frustration again and again: What do I do if I can’t find a new job? Where will we go if we can’t pay our rent?</p> <p>One educator told me she has two callings in life: being a counselor and being a mom. And right now, she feels like she’s failing at both. </p> <p>This morning, I had the chance to visit a Head Start center and see how these challenges are playing out here in Birmingham.</p> <p>Reduced hours. Unemployment. Parents who are at the breaking point trying to keep their jobs and take care of their kids. </p> <p>Families are struggling. </p> <p>So, for a moment, I want to speak to those parents, from one mom to another. </p> <p>This is hard. I know that you would do anything for your child. You want to give them the world. Every parent does. You’re doing your best—working as hard as you can—but you still find yourself sitting at the kitchen table, long after the kids are in bed, surrounded by bills and trying to do impossible math: What gets cut when the only things left are necessities? </p> <p>But for those who feel like you are living day after day just holding your breath, I want you to know this: Help is here.</p> <p>The American Rescue Plan is going to change your lifein so many ways, and today, I want to talk about a fewbig ones:</p> <p>First, we’re going to create a life raft for families who are drowning right now. Already, millions of Americans—including children—have received fourteen-hundred dollars apiece. And with changes to the Child Tax Credit, even more help is coming. </p> <p>So, what does that mean for families right here in Birmingham?</p> <p>In the past, you used to receive a $2,000 tax credit for your child on your tax return. This year, if you have kids under 6-years-old, that number is going to be $3,600. And for older children, it will be $3,000. </p> <p>Before, you would get that money next year when you file your taxes and get your return. But we know that families need help now. So, under the American Rescue Plan, payments are going to start going out this summer. </p> <p>And while, in the past, families in the lowest income bracket didn’t qualify for that money, they now will. </p> <p>Because of this help, the American Rescue Plan is going to cut child poverty in half. </p> <p>Families will be able to buy diapers or replace the shoes their children outgrew. It will mean catching up on past bills so the electricity stays on. </p> <p>But a life raft alone isn’t enough. We want to help families get back on dry ground.</p> <p>Parents want to work, but they can’t if they’re busy taking care of children or supporting remote learning. That’s why millions of women have dropped out of the workforce. </p> <p>Right now, we’re re-opening schools safely, so kids can get back to classrooms and learning with their teachers and friends. And we’re going to make sure you have safe, affordable child care options as well. For millions of families, you’ll be able to get half of your child care expenses back through your tax return early next year—up to $8,000.</p> <p>All parents want to work hard and build a good life for their children. With the support that the American Rescue Plan provides, they’ll be able to do just that. They’ll be able to get back on dry land and breathe freely once again. </p> <p>As a teacher myself, I’ve always appreciated Fred Rogers, or Mr. Rogers to the generations of children who grew up watching his show. </p> <p>He once wrote: “When the gusty winds blow and shake our lives, if we know that people care about us, we may bend with the wind...but we won’t break.”</p> <p>Our nation faces some strong winds right now. Birmingham faces some strong winds. But what I want families to know is this: Your President cares about you. He’s a president for all Americans, and he sees you. </p> <p>This administration is going to make sure that you have what you need to get through the storm. </p> <p>This pandemic will not break us. I<a name="m_-2065348778914278467__GoBack"></a>n fact, we are going to be stronger than ever. </p> <p>That’s what the American Rescue Plan is all about: help for families today, so we can build back better tomorrow. </p></div><div><blockquote><div><div><div><div><br></div></div></div></div></blockquote></div></div></div>-- <br><div><div><table><tbody><tr><td><p><img alt="A on ▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊" height="57" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/ZdGW9ao1vPzFTi62HUYc7iDeUiLR2mI1Y5a_zLukCEQL2LGDVziQA9815OGcIojiBeJZtP7HPc9g3WJ6H-ImsET2tIdaE0SsdiPriZA5MuC3nNZubmWDaaLB7TmVEuEQq6m1-HA2"></p></td><td><p>Sarah Mucha</p><p>Politics Reporter</p><p>▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊ | ▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊</p></td></tr></tbody></table><br></div></div>
