<div><div>Here are fuller quotes from Biden's arrival on the Ellipse.</div><div><br></div><div>Biden walked off Marine One and talked over to the press pool waiting behind barricades near his limousine. </div><div><br></div>Biden: "Let me say something."<div><br></div><div>"It's kind of interesting. When the Republicans put forward an infrastructure plan, they thought everything from broadband to other things were worth paying for infrastructure."</div><div><br></div><div>"When you're in a situation where you can't turn on a water fountain in school because the water affects your health, that's infrastructure. I'm talking about making sure we take asbestos out of schools, that's infrastructure. I'm talking about building high speed rail, that's infrastructure. I'm talking about making sure we are in a situation where we can redo federal buildings that are absolutely leaking energy every single day, that's infrastructure, in addition to roads and bridges and broadband."<br><br></div><div>Talking about Republicans: "They know we need it."</div><div><br></div><div>Question: Are you worried that a higher tax will drive corporations away from the country?</div><div><br></div><div>Biden: "Not at all." "There's no evidence of that." "Tax was 36 percent. Now it's down to 21 percent." (He mentioned his proposed rate of 28 percent, the exact words were hard to hear.)</div><div><br></div><div>"You're talking about companies in the Fortune 500 that haven't paid a single penny in tax for 3 years. Come on man."</div><div><br></div><div>Question: Where is there room to negotiate with Republicans given that your definitions of infrastructure are so different?<br><br>Biden: "Well, I'm not going to negotiate with you on that." "I'm going to push as hard as I can, to compete with the rest of the world." "Everybody else in the rest of the world is investing billions and billions of dollars in infrastructure and we're going to do it here. Thank you."</div><div><br></div><div>Biden then turned to get into the limousine. He didn't answer a shouted question about whether he was concerned about a fourth wave in the coronavirus pandemic.</div><div><br></div><div>As always, please check quotes against transcript. <br></div><div><br></div><div>-- <br><div><br> <table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <a href="https://time.com" target="_blank"><img height="33" src="external_files/external_img04.png"></a> </td> <td> <div> Brian Bennett </div> <div> Senior White House Correspondent </div> <div> ▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊ </div> </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <table> <tbody><tr> <td> <table> <tbody><tr> <td><a href="https://twitter.com/time" target="_blank"><img height="15" src="external_files/external_img34.png"></a></td> <td><a href="https://www.facebook.com/time" target="_blank"><img height="15" src="external_files/external_img13.png"></a></td> <td><a href="https://www.instagram.com/time" target="_blank"><img height="15" src="external_files/external_img23.png"></a></td> <td><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/time/" target="_blank"><img height="15" src="external_files/external_img20.png"></a></td> </tr> </tbody></table> </td> <td> Support our journalism. </td> <td> <a href="https://www.TIME.com/edit-subscribe" target="_blank"><img height="25" src="external_files/external_img15.png"></a> </td> </tr> </tbody></table> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> </div></div></div>
