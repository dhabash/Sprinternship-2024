<div>﻿<div>VPOTUS stood with ﻿Congresswoman Barbara Lee, Senator Alex Padilla and Lt Gov Eleni Kounalakis and several business leaders in the kitchen of Red Door Catering to talk about the investments into new businesses by Community Development Financial Institutions. Reign Free, the owner of the catering business, spoke about how important CDFIs were in making her own business possible.</div><div><br></div><div>Lee in particular spoke about how she had tears in her eyes watching Air Force 2 land at Oakland airport. “She brings us Hope. She lets us know the American dream is real, and it may take a while.”<br><div><br></div><div>This was a theme. Kounalakis called her “daughter of Oakland, daughter of California and you came back home for the first time in your new role,” as she praised Harris for taking the time to talk about CDFIs and for helping get more CDFI funding while still in the Senate. Padilla talked about the shoes he has to fill in taking her Senate seat, and said how proud California is of her.</div><div><br></div><div>VPOTUS in her remarks said “CDFIs particular knew that there were a lot of folks who have bad credit because they've been receiving bad advice. They want to do better, but if you walk into a financial institution and feel you're being judged, you're likely to walk out without receiving help. And that's the other benefit and strength of our community banks.”</div><div><br></div><div>We are holding as VPOTUS does a few local interviews on site before heading to the next stop.</div><div><br></div>The VP’s office sends this background along:<div><p><b>Stop #2: Red Door Catering</b></p> <p>Next, the Vice President will visit a small business called The Red Door Catering to host a listening session. The Red Door Catering, owned by Reign Free, prepares fresh, local ingredients, for diverse events and dining experiences. Notably, The Red Door Catering received both financial and technical support from two Bay Area Community Development Financial Institutions: Accion Opportunity Fund and ICA.</p> <p>The owner of Red Door Catering, Ms. Reign Free, will participate in the listening session. Also joining will be California Lieutenant Governor Eleni Kounalakis, Senator Alex Padilla, Congresswoman Barbara Lee, and executives from Accion and ICA. The listening session will focus on the role of CDFIs, and the importance of providing capital to small businesses in underserved communities.</p> <p><u>Additional Background on the Biden-Harris Administration / Small Businesses</u></p><p>The Vice President has fought for years to ensure small business owners and aspiring small business owners have access to capital - no matter his or her zip code.</p><ul><li>The Vice President worked to secure $12b for CDFIs in one of the last bills she worked on in the senate, which passed in December. This matters, because CDFIs provide capital and resources, usually in the form of financial assistance, to low-income communities and communities of color. </li><li>Now as Vice President, she continues to work with Secretary Yellen on CDFIs lending capacity - so more businesses get the support they need.</li><li>This is in addition to the Biden-Harris Administrations work extending and improving the PPP program, securing $60b for small businesses in the American Rescue Plan, in addition to support for small businesses we're proposing in the American Jobs Plan. </li></ul><br><div><div><div>——</div><div>Edward-Isaac Dovere</div><div>The Atlantic</div><div>@IsaacDovere</div></div></div></div></div></div>
