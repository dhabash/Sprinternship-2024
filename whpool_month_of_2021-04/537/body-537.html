She added three shovels full of dirt. </div> <div><br> </div> <div>She said the cat is coming “pretty soon” but is not at White House yet. </div> <div><br> </div> <div>“No not yet,” she said. </div> <div><br> </div> <div>Kym Hall, Regional Director, National Park Service, also added dirt. </div> <div><br> </div> <div>The two shovels used are made of original White House wood and the blade is painted gold.

These two historic trees are approximately 120 years old, from the same 1900’s landscaping period.</li><li> The ceremonial shovel FLOTUS will use is made of original White House wood, and has been used by several previous administrations.</li></ul> <p> FLOTUS will join members of the National Park Service and White House Executive Residence staff:</p> <p> Kym Hall, Regional Director, National Park Service</p> <p> John Stanwich, National Park Service Liaison to the White House</p> <p> Katie Hinson, Deputy Chief Usher, The White House</p> <p> Dale Haney, Grounds Superintendent, The White House</p> <p> BIOGRAPHIES</p> <p> Kym Hall, Regional Director, National Park Service</p> <p> Kym Hall serves as Area Director for Region 1 – National Capital Area (formerly the National Capital Region) with the National Park Service (NPS).
