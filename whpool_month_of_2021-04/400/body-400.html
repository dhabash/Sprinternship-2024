<div><div>Good morning all. I’ll be your print pooler for President Biden’s trip to Philadelphia today and subsequent stay in Wilmington. He’s scheduled to depart JBA at 12:25pm. The White House passes along the following —<div><br></div><div><p><b>BACKGROUND MEMORANDUM</b></p> <p><b>TO:</b> Out-of-Town Travel Pool</p><p><b>FROM:</b> White House Press Office</p><p><b>DATE:</b> April 30, 2021</p><p><b>RE:</b> Background for the President’s Visit to Pennsylvania</p> <p><b><u>The Need for the American Jobs Plan in Pennsylvania</u></b></p> <p>Pennsylvania’s infrastructure received a C- grade on its Infrastructure Report Card. Toplines on the need for the American Jobs Plan in Pennsylvania include:</p> <ul><li>There are 3,353 bridges and over 7,540 miles of highway in poor condition and each driver pays $620 per year in costs due to driving on roads in need of repair.</li><li>From 2010 to 2020, Pennsylvania has experienced 37 extreme weather events, costing the state up to $10 billion in damages.</li><li>Over the next 20 years, Pennsylvania’s drinking water infrastructure will require $16.8 billion in additional funding.</li><li>In part due to a lack of available and affordable housing, 720,000 renters in Pennsylvania are rent burdened, meaning they spend more than 30% of their income on rent.</li><li>5% of Pennsylvanians live in areas where, by one definition, there is no broadband infrastructure that provides minimally acceptable speeds and 14% of Pennsylvania households do not have an internet subscription.</li><li>In Pennsylvania, 57% of residents live in a childcare desert.</li><li>Manufacturers account for more than 11% of total output in Pennsylvania, employing 565,000 workers, or 9.3% of the state’s workforce.</li><li>In Pennsylvania, an average low-income family spends 8-10% of their income on home energy costs forcing tough choices between paying energy bills and buying food, medicine or other essentials. </li><li>As of 2019, there were 93,861 Pennsylvanians working in clean energy, and the American Jobs Plan invests in creating more well-paying union jobs advancing clean energy production.</li><li>Pennsylvania is home to over 800,000 veterans, 7.3% of whom are women and 55% of whom are over the age of 65.</li></ul> <p><b><u>The Need for the American Families Plan in Pennsylvania</u></b></p> <p>The American Families Plan (AFP) is an investment in Pennsylvania’s children and families. Toplines on the need for the American Families Plan in Pennsylvania include:</p> <ul><li><b>HIGHER EDUCATION:</b> The average cost of a 2-year degree in Pennsylvania is almost $5,700 per year, and high costs are part of the reason just 70% of students in Pennsylvania are able to complete a postsecondary degree of any kind within 6 years of enrolling. The AFP will provide at least two years of free community college to all students, including Dreamers. It will also increase the maximum Pell Grant awards by approximately $1,400 to support the nearly 200,000 students in Pennsylvania who rely on Pell for their education. In addition, the AFP will provide support to Pennsylvania’s 24 Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), Tribal Colleges and Universities (TCUs), Hispanic-serving institutions (HSIs), and other minority-serving institutions (MSIs).</li><li><b>UNIVERSAL PRE-SCHOOL: </b>Across the U.S., high-minority and high-poverty high schools have seen 9.4% and 11.4% declines in college enrollment, respectively. Just 48,700 (or 17%) of the 286,000 3- and 4-year-olds in Pennsylvania have access to publicly-funded pre-school. The AFP will provide access to free, high-quality pre-school to all 3- and 4-year-olds in Pennsylvania.</li><li><b>INVESTING IN TEACHERS:</b> Pennsylvania has seen a 49% decline in new teacher supply. In Pennsylvania just 6% of teachers are teachers of color, while students of color make up 35% of the student population. The AFP will invest $9 billion in our teachers.</li><li><b>CHILD CARE: </b>The average annual cost of a child care center for a toddler in Pennsylvania is $11,400, meaning that a two-parent household would on average need to spend 11% of their income to afford care for one child every year. The AFP will enable low and middle-income families to pay no more than 7% of their income on high-quality child care, generating lifetime benefits for over 289,000 children in Pennsylvania and helping working families.</li><li><b>PAID LEAVE:</b> In Pennsylvania and across the nation, more than 110 million workers lack access to paid family leave and nearly 84 million lack access to paid medical leave. The AFP will create a national, comprehensive paid family and medical leave program.</li><li><b>CHILD NUTRITION: </b>16% of children in Pennsylvania live in food insecure households and 28% are obese. The AFP will ensure that the nutritional needs of Pennsylvania’s children are met by expanding access to free school meals to an additional 288,000 students and providing 947,000 students with resources to purchase food over the summer.</li><li><b>HEALTH CARE: </b>The AFP will make the health insurance premium reductions in the ARP permanent. In Pennsylvania, that means 122,000 uninsured people will gain coverage and 126,000 will on average save hundreds of dollars per year on their premiums.</li></ul><ul><li><b>TAX CUTS FOR WORKING FAMILIES</b>: 13% of children under the age of 18 in Pennsylvania are considered poor. In addition, nearly 24% of people in Pennsylvania have household incomes below basic family budget thresholds. The AFP will bolster financial security and spur economic growth in Pennsylvania by reducing taxes on the middle class and those striving to break into it.</li></ul> <p><b><u>The Impact of the American Rescue Plan in Pennsylvania</u></b></p> <p>In total, Pennsylvania will receive the following American Rescue Plan (ARP) funding:</p><p>· $7.4 billion in state fiscal relief and $4.9 billion in local fiscal relief.</p><p>· More than $5.1 billion in relief for K-12 schools.</p><p>· Economic impact payments of up to $1,400 per person (above the $600 per person provided in December) for more than 8.1 million adults and 2.8 million children (or 86% of all adults and 84% of all children in the state).</p><p>· Additional relief of up to $1,600 per child through the Child Tax Credit to the families of 2,368,000 children, lifting 140,000 children out of poverty.</p><p>· Additional relief of up to nearly $1,000 through the Earned Income Tax Credit.</p><p>· Credit to 700,000 childless workers, including many in frontline jobs.</p><p>· Marketplace health insurance premiums that are $1402 lower per month for a 60-year old couple earning $75,000 per year.</p> <p><b><u>Federal Support for Pennsylvania Vaccinations</u></b></p> <p><b>Pharmacies: </b>As of April 28, the Biden-Harris Administration has made vaccine available in over 1,600 pharmacies across the state, with over 1,100 receiving deliveries in the past week. Participating stores are primarily Rite Aid, CVS, Topco, and Walmart locations but span multiple other pharmacy partners.</p> <p><b>Community Health Centers: </b>The Biden-Harris Administration has invited 46 health centers in Pennsylvania to receive direct vaccine allocations, spanning 30 cities. The centers combined have sites at over 300 different care delivery locations across the state. As of April 28, 37,700 doses have been delivered to Community Health Centers in Pennsylvania through the federal vaccinations program.</p> <p><b>Federal Funding:</b> As of April 26, the Biden-Harris Administration has provided over $212 million to the state to support vaccination operations. There are 13 federally-supported community vaccination centers in the state, including one FEMA Pilot site at the Pennsylvania Convention Center. There are over 375 federal personnel currently deployed to the state to support vaccination operations, in addition to over 430 federally-funded National Guard members currently supporting the COVID-19 response.</p></div> </div> </div>-- <br><div><div>Morgan Chalfant<div>White House correspondent, The Hill</div><div>▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊</div><div>▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊</div></div></div>
