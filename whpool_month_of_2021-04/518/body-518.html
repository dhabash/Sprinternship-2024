  <div> <div>Here’s a rough transcript, per Otter, of the five questions VP Harris took at the end of the roundtable event. As of 2:17pm, pool is waiting in the press vans outside the Innovation Hub in Cincinnati. I’ll tweet out a few more pictures from the roundtable @TaylorPopielarz.</div> <div><br> </div> <div><br> </div> <div>Q: Madam Vice President, could you speak to the crisis in India right now concerning COVID and what lessons you take from that?</div> <div> <br> </div> <div>VP: There is no question that it is a great tragedy, in terms of the loss of life, and as I have said before, and I will say again, we as a country have made a commitment to the people of India to support them. And we've made already a commitment in terms of a dollar amount that will go to PPE and a number of other things. But it is tragic. And, you know, my prayers go to the people on the suffering, the blatant suffering that is happening.</div> <div> <br> </div> <div>Q: Does it give you any concern about how their experience could affect what's happening in the United States concerning COVID?</div> <div> <br> </div> <div>VP: Well, I mean, we are all part of a world community. And to the extent that any of us as human beings who have any level of compassion see suffering anywhere around the world, it impacts all of us.</div> <div> <br> </div> <div>[Sen. Brown jumps in to build off that answer]</div> <div> <br> </div> <div>Aide: We’ll take one more question.</div> <div> <br> </div> <div>Q: Madam Vice President, regarding infrastructure, as you're continuing to push the American jobs plan, what's your message and how are you going to approach Republican voters or voters in general who may be skeptical of this expanded definition of infrastructure,? Because the conversation here right now was focused on infrastructure and, you know, hitting all corners of life, but a lot of voters feel that it should just be roads and bridges.</div> <div> <br> </div> <div>VP: I am willing to bet you that when the people of Cincinnati get on those buses being driven by Troy Miller's members, they do not ask are you a republican or democrat? I'm willing to bet you. When we are talking about those moms who need to walk on the sidewalk to get to the bus pushing a stroller walking a toddler, they are not identifying their problem through the lens of who they voted for in the last election. When we are looking at the capacity to grow the economic vitality of communities, including small businesses, and increase the productivity of the workforce, much less expand the workforce, what we know is that the reality is that people regardless of who they vote for him with which party they registered with, that's what they want. And that's what they want to see their government focus on.</div> <div> <br> </div> <div>Q: Can you speak to your priority for broadband, Madam Vice President?</div> <div> <br> </div> <div>VP: [inaudible] priority — is something I've worked on for quite some time. It is it is an extension of this conversation, frankly. I gave a speech yesterday talking about this. I was in, you will appreciate this Chairman, I was with our former colleagues, Maggie Hasson and Jeanne Shaheen in New Hampshire, visiting the New Hampshire Electric Coop. and met with some workers there who were part of a legacy of folks at that coop will help build electrification for rural New Hampshire. And it was on the basis of the work, literally the physical basis of the work they did as a result of the 1936 Rural Electrification Act, which was about saying, let's get electricity, everybody to say, now, let's get broadband to everybody. It’s the same point. kids can't do their homework. Without the access to the internet. You know, some of us had Encyclopedia Britannica, well, let me tell you that is a day gone by. Our seniors, we now know the capacity of access and affordable access to broadband to bring health care through telemedicine. Again, our small businesses, it has become very clear for a small business to actually survive much less thrive, they need access to high speed internet to be able to move their product, to advertise their product and to engage with their customers. So it crosses all levels, all communities. And, you know, in the past with electrification, I think it was one of the great examples of the role of responsibility of the federal government to meet the needs of the people where they are and to invest in America in a way that we will be competitive going forward. Broadband is the next example of that.</div> <div> <br> </div> <div>Q: And do you see any bridges in this area qualifying for that top 10 list? </div> <div> <br> </div> <div>VP: Well, I can tell you that I know about the Brent Spence Bridge, and it is a very important bridge in America. And I'm sure that there will be a lot of conversation about its qualifications for some support out of the American Jobs Plan.</div> <div> <br> </div> <div>[end]</div> </div> <div><br> </div> <br> <div> <div> <div> <b>Taylor Popielarz</b></div> <div> Spectrum News Washington Reporter</div> <div> C: ▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊</div> <div> @TaylorPopielarz</div> <div> <br> </div> <br> </div> <br> </div> <br> The contents of this e-mail message and <br>any attachments are intended solely for the <br>addressee(s) and may contain confidential <br>and/or legally privileged information.
