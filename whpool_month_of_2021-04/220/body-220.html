  <div> <div> <div>This is long. Sorry I’m advance. </div> <div><br> </div> <div>Supervisor of the plant greets her when she walks in. He explained to VP Harris the beginning process of building the buses. Pool was moved before we could hear their full conversation. </div> <div><br> </div> <div>The VP then moved over to a different section to meet up with Mark Ward, the manager where he explained how the body of the electric bus (the big yellow part) gets attached. Couldn’t really hear through masks but the VP asked questions while Ward explained how the seats get attached, the body gets fastened, etc. </div> <div><br> </div> <div>The pool then moved outside where all of the electric vehicles were held. One bus was plugged into a white and green charging station.  Mark Childers says it takes 3 hours to fully charge the bus. The bus is named the Jooley. The charge can last a full day depending on routes. </div> <div><br> </div> <div>No charging stations are at the schools yet. </div> <div><br> </div> <div>What’s required for a traditional school bus driver to drive these. Childers says it’s not a lot of work to switch over. Says the drivers have raved about it. </div> <div><br> </div> <div>“School bus drivers at every special people.”Says she remembers her bus drivers. “They are very much a part of the educational ecosystem.”</div> <div><br> </div> <div>Btw, the bus is on and completely silent. Can’t hear a thing. </div> <div><br> </div> <div>Harris: “You guys are a model of what our country is capable of doing.” </div> <div><br> </div> <div>She asks how much does it normally cost to fill up a traditional school bus. Mark says “On an average of 15 years, $85,000 of fuel costs.” </div> <div><br> </div> <div>She points out “not to mention the costs associated with the fumes, with the exhaust.” He agrees. </div> <div><br> </div> <div>Harris on yellow color: “There’s just so much nostalgia about the yellow school bus. Your gone to this new technology but you kept the yellow bus. That’s very special.”</div> <div><br> </div> <div>Says The President knew she was coming out and said he would love to be here too. </div> <div><br> </div> <div>Harris: “This Thomas bus is a model for the country and the world on what is possible.”</div> <div><br> </div> <div>Says it’s a public health issue because of fumes kids inhale, the emissions it emits and the cost savings of the electric buses. </div> <div><br> </div> <div>The Republican Mayor of Hawthorne thanks Harris for coming. Thank you so much for coming and passes it to Gov. Cooper. <br> </div> <div><br> </div> <div>Regan thanks Gov. Cooper for his leadership and Harris’ goals of electrifying and cleaning up schools. </div> <div><br> </div> <div>She answered a couple of questions right after. Working on quotes now. </div> <div><br> </div> <div> <div>-- <div> <p> Eugene Daniels | White House Reporter &amp; Playbook co-Author | <b>POLITICO </b>▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊ | <a href="http://twitter.com/EugeneDaniels2">@EugeneDaniels2</a></p> <br> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div>
