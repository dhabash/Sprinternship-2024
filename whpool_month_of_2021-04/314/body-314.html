  <div> <div> <div> <div>** Note about the school we visited, like all other schools on Navajo Nation, it is federally funded through the Bureau of Indian Education appeals for improvements have to be to the federal government. There are no property taxes on Navajo Nation. Thanks to Noel Lyn Smith of The Daily Times in Farmington, NM, for background. </div> </div> <div><br> </div> <div>Motorcade left the school at 11:34am which means Dr. Biden met with students and teachers for an hour and half. We are en route to the vaccination center. As we entered Fort Defiance, about 20 people stood on the side of the road, some in neon reflective vests, filming and waving. A sign outside a school we passed says “Home of the Scouts.” </div> <div><br> </div> <div>In Fort Defiance, more workers stood outside in aprons. Some wore hospital scrubs. Clusters of 5-10 stood near pickup trucks. Some had dogs. Some were kids. An couple of elders stood leaning on canes and waving. A lone brown horse with a black mane was eating in a field and paid us no attention. </div> <div><br> </div> <div>Arrival at noon. Tsehootsooi Medical Center, a tribal healthcare facility with a COVID-19 vaccination clinic on the Navajo Nation. Also federally funded. </div> <div><br> </div> <div>Dr. Biden said hello to fire fighters and emerged from cafe carrying two white boxes with cellophane windows on top. Your pooler asked what she was carrying. </div> <div><br> </div> <div>“Cookies for the workers” </div> <div><br> </div> <div>She was accompanied by President Nez and First Lady Phenelia Nez. There are two people in uniform, public health officers. </div> <div><br> </div> <div>She was shown around by Dr. Sandi Adkins, Chief Executive Officer, who is the one in the white hat in photos. And Mrs. Margaret Lynch, Executive Vice President for Corporate Operations. </div> <div><br> </div> <div>It is hard to hear. We are outside the tent in the parking lot of the medical center. </div> <div><br> </div> <div>DR. ADKINS </div> <div>When we got our first doses of the vaccine it was January. We had icicles on our eyelashes. (I believe she said they were administering to people in their cars.)</div> <div><br> </div> <div>BIDEN </div> <div>Oh my goodness </div> <div><br> </div> <div>ADKINS</div> <div>Now we are doing them in the tent. </div> <div><br> </div> <div>Adkins then brought her the front of the tent to meet four members of the hospital staff, names below. The one in uniform is Commander Leah Earl-Begay. Introducing chief administrative officer Ms. Tina James-Tafoya, Lynch said she was former Miss Navajo. “I always hate when she tells people that,” said James-Tafoya, who was dressed in a traditional teal outfit. </div> <div><br> </div> <div>On the other side of the tent, Biden was introduced to 8-10 frontline workers, mostly RNs in scrubs but also administrators. “These are the people who were directing traffic and helping people park,” said Adkins.</div> <div><br> </div> <div>President Nez and First Lady Phenelia walked around elbow bumping workers. </div> <div><br> </div> <div>President Nez spoke: </div> <div><br> </div> <div>“These are the warriors on the front line of the pandemic” (applause) </div> <div>He also said, “Social media brought a lot of people in.”</div> <div><br> </div> <div>Adkins said, “we’d put out something saying, ‘come on down, they have 500 doses left,’ and people came. That’s how we got to the rate of vaccination that we are.”</div> <div><br> </div> <div>FLOTUS asked, “Were you able to get out to people on rural areas?” Adkins said yes. They had mobile vaccinations. </div> <div><br> </div> <div>It was very windy. Dr. Biden seemed to have learned a lesson from yesterday and was wearing a black scarf. Up close you could see her dress had a tiered skirt. </div> <div><br> </div> <div>President Nez introduced <a href="https://www.ihs.gov/sites/aboutihs/themes/responsive2017/display_objects/documents/bios/RoselynTso_NavajoArea.pdf">Roselyn Tso</a>, Navajo area director for Indian Health Servicd (please check title). She’s in a pink cardigan in photos. He said he’d told President Biden that he should nominate her to the Bureau of Indian Affairs. </div> <div><br> </div> <div>Dr. Biden laughed. “I happen to know that. I happen to know that! I’ve been briefed on this.”</div> <div><br> </div> <div>Nez: We went 10 straight days with no deaths, low numbers. </div> <div><br> </div> <div>Roselyn: During the pandemic we brought in 1000 volunteers. Every day it is a very coordinated approach that requires lots of leadership. </div> <div><br> </div> <div>FLOTUS: You did a great job. You did a great job.</div> <div><br> </div> <div>Adkins: We’ve required a mask mandate. We are very thankful for all of the citizens here. </div> <div><br> </div> <div>FLOTUS: Working together, right? Working together. </div> <div><br> </div> <div>She turned to the workers: “Thank you to all the front line workers.”</div> <div><br> </div> <div>Adkins: President Nez put some mandates in place early on that were not popular. I’m sure he got a lot of guff for them. But people knew we had to do that to protect each other. </div> <div><br> </div> <div>Nez: Tell your husband Joe that we appreciate the force of his action, that within days of the Inauguration he was signing the emergency declaration for Navajo Nation. </div> <div><br> </div> <div>We appreciate the focus and attention you bring to our homeland. </div> <div><br> </div> <div> <div>Daniel Tso, chair of health educaion and </div> <div>CEO of Indian Health Service spoke. He’s an elder with gray hair pulled back and was emotional. </div> <br> </div> <div>Daniel Tso: We are determined, (emphasized) DETERMINED to provide the best healthcare we can to the Navajo people. It’s the frontline workers that don’t get the recognition the reward that other folks do and that’s what we put in our hearts and daily prayers. <br> </div> <div><br> </div> <div>Tso continued: I think the main the we have to do going forward is focus on mental health. People who’ve experienced Covid or who have lost people from Covid feel that. </div> <div><br> </div> <div>The Navajo way is not to forge forward alone. We go along as a community, as a group. We have to keep doing that. We appreciate President Joe Biden. Last night you heard about the women nation. He is the perfect example of women nation by naming a woman Vice President. </div> <div><br> </div> <div>FLOTUS: Thank you for recognizing my husband’s commitment to healthcare and mental healthcare not just for Navajo Nation, but for all Americans. </div> <div><br> </div> <div>Adkins emphasizes how much they relied on federal funding and how grateful they were for the infusion from the Biden adminstration.</div> <div><br> </div> <div>Adkins: There was a point halfway through last year where we didn’t know if we could keep the lights. </div> <div><br> </div> <div>But because of the CARES act and newer funding during the Biden admin, “we never had to lay anyone off.”</div> <div><br> </div> <div>Before leaving, Dr. Biden was presented with another beautiful blanket, this one turquoise and black. She will have quite a nice collection! </div> <div><br> </div> <div>A sandstorm was kicking up just as we left around 12:33. A couple of clinic workers were laughing. “Two hours!” Which was how long they’d been waiting. “But at least we got to be outside,” said one. </div> <div><br> </div> <div>En route back to Albuquerque.</div> <div><br> </div> <div><b>Background from FLOTUS office (you have this, but for easy reference)</b></div> <div><br> </div> <div> <blockquote> <div> <div> <p> <u>MEDICAL CENTER</u></p> <p> The First Lady will visit Tsehootsooi Medical Center, a tribal healthcare facility with a COVID-19 vaccination clinic on the Navajo Nation.
