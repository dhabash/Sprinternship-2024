<div><div><div>"Pool Force One" touched down at 10:45 a.m. in Laconia, N.H. following a steeply banked and viscerally felt U-turn to land into the wind. (Your pooler is reminded that this jet is under a highly skilled military officer's control.)</div><div><div><br></div><div>Going 520 MPH (according to an on-board monitor), we passed VPOTUS somewhere in mid-flight. Pool was off the plane in time to walk about 100 yards across a field and see her aircraft taxi after 10:52 a.m. wheels-down.</div><div><br></div><div>No interaction with staff during the flight.</div><div><br></div><div>VPOTUS disembarked at 11:02 a.m. </div><div><br></div><div>Tarmac greeters included Sen. Maggie Hassan, Gov. Chris Sununu and, per the White House:</div><div><br></div><div>- Rep. Chris Pappas</div><div>- Andrew Hosmer, Mayor of Laconia, N.H.</div><div><br></div><div>VPOTUS spoke to the four greeters as a group. Noise from her plane's auxiliary power unit, and from a stiff wind that brought a nearby windsock to full horizontal, kept your pooler from hearing anything more specific than hearty laughter before VPOTUS walked away to her waiting ride.</div><div><br></div><div>Your pooler is in a van for an estimated 45-minute motorcade trip to the New Hampshire Electric Co-Op in the town of Plymouth. </div><div><br></div></div> <p><a name="m_4541338946115690731_m_2314744746908565072_m_-2539670153241246737_m_3758034219403418189__MailAutoSig" rel="noreferrer noreferrer noreferrer noreferrer"> </a></p> <p><b>______________________________</b></p> <p><b>David Martosko</b></p> <p>White House correspondent<br><i>DailyMailTV</i><br>Senior Content Executive<br><i>ZENGER NEWS</i><br>▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊<br>@dmartosko</p></div></div>
