 <p> Special thanks to TV poolers for help with audio. Here are quotes from POTUS visit to Arlington National Cemetery and a few more details. <br> <br> <b>Details: </b><br> <br> After walking through the grass, he stopped at the wreath and held it. He made the sign of the cross and then saluted. <br> <br> <b>Quotes: </b><br> <br> Reporter: What does this day mean for you? (Not a direct quote.) <br> “It means that I’m always amazed at generation after generation, the women and men prepared to give their lives for their country. They don’t give it for their country per se, they give it for their brothers, their sisters, their mothers, their fathers, their uncles, their aunts.”<br> <br> “It means I have trouble these days ever showing up at a cemetery not thinking of my son, Beau, who proudly insisted on putting on that uniform and going with his unit to Iraq and giving up his spot as attorney general in the state of Delaware because he thought it was the right thing to do.” <br> <br> Reporter: “Was it a hard decision to make sir?” POTUS: “No, it wasn’t. To me, it was absolutely clear. Absolutely clear. We went for two reasons: the end of Bin Laden and the end of safe haven. From the very beginning, you may recall, I never thought we were there to somehow unify Iraq. Excuse me, Afghanistan. It’s never been done. It’s never been done.” <br> <br> <br> <b>: : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : :</b><br> <br> <b>Courtney Rozen</b><br> White House Reporter <br>She/her<br> <br> <b>Bloomberg Government</b><br> <br> ▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊<br> ▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊<br> <br> <br> <br> </p>
