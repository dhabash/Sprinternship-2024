   <div> <div>POTUS, FLOTUS, newly confirmed grandson Hunter and extended Biden family left church at 2:08 pm, walking into the beautiful spring sunshine. They spent some minutes outside the doors for photos and chatting. Jill Biden then walked to her SUV and re-emerged with a bouquet of flowers that she took to the other side of the church, where the Biden family graves, including that of Beau, are located. During this time, the president stayed with the group of friends/relatives talking. Frequent laughter drifted across the grassy church yard. At 2:17 pm, the president and that main group strolled to the other side of the church, presumably joining FLOTUS, although pool was no longer able to witness anything.</div> <br> <br> <div> <table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><b>Sebastian Smith</b></p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p><i>White House correspondent</i></p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td>@SebastianAFP</td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p>Tel: <a href="tel:▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊">▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊</a> - Mob: <a href="tel:▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊">▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊</a></p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><img alt="Agence France-Presse" height="40" src="http://signature.afp.com/logo/LogoAFP.png"></p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> Sent from my iPhone</div> </div>
