 <p> <br> President Joe Biden’s first Cabinet meeting was held in the East Room instead of the typical Cabinet meeting room to abide by Covid safety provisions. The Cabinet, as well as key staff members, sat at large tables arranged in a square formation. <br> <br> Each person was seated with an empty chair separating them from the next. Cabinet members were each wearing a mask. Biden was not wearing a mask as he made opening remarks. <br> <br> The president was seated with Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin to his left and Secretary of State Antony Blinken to his right. Vice President Kamala Harris was sitting opposite Biden, facing him. <br> <br> (<a href="https://twitter.com/natashakorecki/status/1377680880873963530?s=20">photos here</a>) <br> <br> Biden opened by referencing his American Jobs rollout in Pittsburgh then noted he was asking five Cabinet members to take “special <br> responsibility” to “engage the public on selling the plan,” working with senior White House officials and Congress.<br> <br> He said that would be a subject of the meeting as well as a directive from him to Cabinet members on spending and his “commitment to Buy American to make sure that they’re spending on American made goods, American corporations and American employees.” <br> <br> “Today I’m directing every member of the Cabinet, I mean specifically every one of them, to take a hard look at their agency spending and make sure it abides by my Buy American standards.” <br> <br> Biden added he’d ask each Cabinet member to report back to him at the next meeting. <br> <br> He did not take questions despite a couple shouted out. “Mr. President, at the border!” Fox’s Peter Doocy attempted, to no avail. <br> <br> <br> Natasha Korecki<br> White House Reporter<br> POLITICO<br> ▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊ <br> @natashakorecki <br> <br> </p>
