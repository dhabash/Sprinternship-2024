  <div> Full quotes from meeting between VP Kamala Harris and Guatemalan president Alejandro Giammattei:<br> </div> <div> <br> </div> <div> <u>VP Harris:</u></div> <div> <br> </div> <div> <div>“I value the partnership between our countries and our people and I look forward to working together to strengthen our ties around our common interests. When we last spoke by telephone a few weeks ago we discussed our shared commitment to expanding opportunities in Guatemala and throughout the region. And as you of course know, the people of Guatemala have been suffering greatly because of the recent hurricanes, the persistent drought and of course the damage from covid-19. And as we have discussed, these are the acute factors that in many ways are causing people to live their homes despite the fact that they would probably prefer to stay. There are also long-standing issues that are often called the root causes of immigration. We are looking at the issue of poverty, and the lack therefore of economic opportunities; the issue of extreme weather conditions and the lack of climate adaptation, as well as corruption and the lack of good governance, and violence against women, indigenous people, LBGTQ people and Afro-descendants.”</div> <div><br> </div> <div>“We want to work with you to address both the acute causes as well as the root causes in a way that will bring hope to the people of Guatemala that there will be an opportunity for them if they stay at home.”</div> <div>“Part of the spirit behind our work is of course that the Western hemisphere is our collective home, and the people in it and our neighbors, including the people of Guatemala are nearby and we have a responsibility therefore to engage.” </div> <div>“The United States plans to increase relief to the region, strengthen our cooperation to manage migration in an effective, secure and humane manner. In addition to our bilateral work and our multilateral efforts, the United States is building a comprehensive strategy with international institutions with allies around the globe, with foundations here in the United States and the private sector as well as community organizations. </div> <div>“In addition, tomorrow I will meet with Guatemalan community leaders and I’m eager to hear their thoughts, the people of the region of course must be at the center of everything we do.”</div> <div>"I believe that the work in order to be successful will require everyone’s participation, and I do believe also will require political will and hard work to accomplish our goals, but I am confident that we can make progress and create a sense of hope for the future.”</div> <div>“Mr President, again, I am honored to meet with you. I look forward to traveling to Guatemala and meeting with you in person. Currently our plan is to come there in the month of June.” </div> <div><br> </div> <div><br> </div> <div><u>President Giammattei </u>thanked Ms Harris for hosting the meeting. </div> <div>(Difficult to hear translator even on tape but key points below...) </div> <div>Said he agreed with her on “creating hope.” </div> <div>Objective was for “people to find here opportunities to move ahead and therefore not need to go abroad to the United States.”</div> <div>“The Guatemalan government wishes to be your partner in order to address.... not only poverty but of so many evils that affect us.”</div> <div>“When I hear you speak of crazy human beings at the center of things, I can only congratulate myself and you for adopting such a position,” (yes, triple-checked that quote...unclear what he is referring to...)</div> <div><br> </div> <div>“We need to fight, to preserve the life of all members of our society...I’m so happy to be able to speak to you and I’m looking forward to you coming in June, but from here to June, I believe that we should build a roadmap between government and government so that we can reach agreement... to ensure peace, progress and development, and also so that we can secure the cooperation that we need from you.”</div> <div><br> </div> <div>VP Harris concluded: “Muchas Grazias.”</div> <div><br> </div> That's all from me folks.
