<div><p>Passing along one final piece of background from the White House ahead of POTUS' Tuesday virtual tour of the Proterra plant in Greenville, South Carolina.</p> <p><i>Tomorrow, the President will take a virtual tour of a Proterra electric bus and battery manufacturing plant in Greenville, South Carolina. There are over 475,000 school buses and 65,000 transit buses on our streets today, serving millions of students and transit riders. Most of these buses currently run on diesel, which has a negative impact on human health, especially for children.</i></p> <p><i>The President made a commitment that all American-made buses would be zero-emission by 2030. To advance this goal, the American Jobs Plan includes a total of $45 billion to accelerate the adoption of zero-emission transit buses and school buses. This investment will create good jobs, support domestic manufacturing, tackle a major source of greenhouse gas emissions, and improve health for some of our most vulnerable populations.</i></p><p>And that, as the kids say, is a wrap. </p><div><br></div>-- <br><div><div><div><div><div><div><div><div><div><div><div><div>Christian Datoc</div><div>Senior White House Correspondent</div><div><div>The Daily Caller</div><div><div>▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊</div><div>▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊</div><div>▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊</div></div></div><div>▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊</div><div>C: ▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊</div><div>@TocRadio</div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>
