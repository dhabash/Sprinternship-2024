  POTUS motorcade arrived at the Wilmington Country Club just north of Greenville at 12:58 pm. Pool could not immediately see the president as we are now pausing in the car park. <div>The Country Club has a well known golf course. It’s a game Biden has long played - though not since becoming president.</div> <div>Pool is asking the White House for details on whom he’s with and what they’re up to.</div> <div>The course visible by pool was busy with people playing and practicing putting. As this was not announced in advance the motorcade’s appearance was evidently a surprise and we could see club members filming the event on cellphones.<br> <br> <div> <table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><b>Sebastian Smith</b></p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p><i>White House correspondent</i></p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td>@SebastianAFP</td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p>Tel: <a href="tel:▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊">▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊</a> - Mob: <a href="tel:▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊">▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊</a></p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><img alt="Agence France-Presse" height="40" src="http://signature.afp.com/logo/LogoAFP.png"></p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> Sent from my iPhone</div> </div>
