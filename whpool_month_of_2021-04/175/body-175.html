<div>“I sent to Congress my funding priorities for the appropriations process including two key public health initiatives.<br><br>“First is like DARPA at the Defense Department which is designed to develop, and had developed, great tools to protect us and enhance our physical safety, I’m proposing a $6.5 billion appropriation for what we call ARPA H, which is focused on health issues.<br><br>“This is a primary breakthrough that we hope can detect, and treat and prevent diseases like Alzheimers and diabetes and give us a chance to end cancer as we know it, because it will focus exclusively on those items.<br><br>“And secondly I am proposing a historic funding increase of 50% of $4billion to end the opioid crisis which still ravages the country. It has taken so many lives over the last few years. Resources both for the states and the tribes for treatment as well as prevention.<br><br>“It also includes the largest ever funding increase for Title 1 schools – schools for disadvantaged ... to lift up the millions of children in low-income families and it’ll put them in a position where all the data – we talked a lot about this – the data shows that it puts a child from a household that is a lower income household in a position if they start school – not daycare – but school at 3 and 4 years old, there’s overwhelming evidence that they will compete all the way through high school and beyond.”<div><br></div>-- <br><div><div><div><div>Rob Crilly<div>White House correspondent</div><div>office: ▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊</div><div>cell: ▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊</div><div>@robcrilly</div></div></div></div></div></div>
