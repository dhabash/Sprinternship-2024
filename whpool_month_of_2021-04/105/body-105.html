<div>To the shouted questions about Russia and Putin, Biden said: "Folks, I'm going to be speaking to Russia, and my conversation with President Putin, shortly after the meeting is over."<div><br>Highlights of the rest of the 3 minute spray:<br>Biden started with good economic news, reading from notes.<br>“There's some good news today, and that is that retail sales just last month have surged by 9.8%. American families received that $1400 check and auto sales are up 50% Things are moving. These checks are providing a heck of a lot of immediate relief for families, and in turn leading to support for our economic recovery. Today's news comes on top of the recent news that we created 900,000 jobs in the month of March. First two months of my administration we've created more jobs than in the first two months of any administration in American history.”<br><br>He credited the lawmakers for getting the package fast.<br><br>“I want to thank the members who supported the American Rescue Plan. And we still have a long way to go. We're 8 million jobs down from what it was, more than before the pandemic began. But America's coming back.”<br><br><div>He talked about the “Asian American... and Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islanders community. I think most people don't realize just how diverse it is, how many different dialects and languages and the like are spoken, which is part of what we have to deal with.... We need to stand the AAPI community as a whole of government response with what we have to get done.” Noted that he signed an order related to racial equity soon after taking office. “That’s still the plan. That's my objective. And Kamala and I are heartened by the Senate's overwhelming bipartisan effort yesterday” in approving the hate crimes bill. <br><br>“That's a big deal.... I thought it was gonna pass but my Lord. I gotta tell you, we took a vote here in the administration, you're going to handle the jobs bill,” Biden said to Hirono,<div><br></div><div><br><div><div><div><div><div><div><div><p><b>Todd J.
