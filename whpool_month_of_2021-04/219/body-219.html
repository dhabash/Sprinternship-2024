  <div> <div> <div> <p> The previous email should say “Sorry in advance” for the length. The motorcade was holding and is now rolling as of 3:59</p> <p> VP took two questions after speaking. One on Northern Triangle work and one on vaccine hesitancy. </p> <p> Full quotes below. </p> <br> <p> On Northern Triangle: So, we are making progress but let's just be very clear that this is a complicated, complex issue that actually has been an issue for a long time, and the work that we are putting into it now is work that is going to require a long standing commitment beyond administrations. It is work that is not going to evidence its impact overnight because the issues are so intractable and we're looking at my focus which is a diplomatic focus on the Northern Triangle, it is about bringing together as I did the members of the cabinet.</p> <br> <p> And the progress there is that Commerce is going to host a virtual trade mission. The Department of Agriculture under the leadership of Secretary Vilsack is increasing its focus on the work that needs to happen to support the agricultural efforts of that region that have been decimated because of extreme climate because of poverty but it's evidenced itself in a number of ways including stream food insecurity. </p> <br> <p> We’re bringing together USAID, which is increasing its work around its program that is focused on disaster relief. So this is some of the work that's happening as you know I met last week with the Prime Minister of Japan in approached him about the work that Japan can do in growth to assist. We are also working through the UN, with Ambassador Thomas Greenfield around bringing our allies, to really renew a focus in that region. So it is something that is going to require diplomatic work, it is something that is going to require a multilateral approach, in addition to what we can do with our agencies. </p> <br> <p> This week I'm bringing together foundation leaders from across our country to really encourage them to do more in terms of the civil society piece of this, which will be about both growing the work that they've already done historically, but also engaging civil society in the region in the Northern Triangle. </p> <div><br> </div> On Vaccine Hesitancy: <p> We have to take seriously the vaccine hesitancy issue. And I will argue however that we need to do that and always couple that with what we need to do to make sure people have access and they know where to actually get the vaccine because I'm finding as many people want to take it as just need to figure out where they can get i. </p> <br> <p> And by the way today as you all know April 19 we now have opened it up for everyone, everyone is eligible over the age of 16. In terms of the hesitancy issue it's real. So that is about continuing to do the work of reminding folks that it is safe, that it is effective that it will save their lives, reminding folks that it is not enough to get vaccinated, we also want to make sure people continue to wear their masks, social distance wash their hands.</p> <br> <p> But you know, we also have to realize that part of the hesitancy, I'm hearing more of this comes from the fact that some people think, well, this thing just got created too quickly. Like, it just overnight, it seems to have occurred well we have to correct the record and make people aware, and Dr. Fauci has talked about this, this vaccine is the product of a long period of extensive research over many many years. So, this is the work we have to do which is to educate people about the effectiveness specifically as it relates to the J&amp;J vaccine. I know the CDC has information on their website for people who are concerned, but the reality is that at least right now and I believe that all of the scientists and the public health experts are telling us it has affected a very very small fraction of those who have received it, and the most important thing again is that everyone gets the vaccine when it's their turn. We remain committed to the fact that we will have enough vaccines in the United States by the first of May to vaccinate everyone. And so we want to encourage everyone to do their part, and to get their vaccine.</p> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> </div> <div><br> </div> <div> <div>-- <div> <p> Eugene Daniels | White House Reporter &amp; Playbook co-Author | <b>POLITICO </b>▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊ | <a href="http://twitter.com/EugeneDaniels2">@EugeneDaniels2</a></p> <br> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div>
