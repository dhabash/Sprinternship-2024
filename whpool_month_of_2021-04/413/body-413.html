 <p> The president and first lady appeared onstage at 6:12 p.m. holding hands. Biden had a kick in his step as the first lady clapped. <br> <br> FLOTUS introduced the president, who began speaking at 6:18 p.m. <br> <br> Near the beginning of the remarks, the president was interrupted by a group of protesters who were shouting “Abolish ICE” and something about detentions centers. One shouted, “We voted for you too.” “Our families are dying,” a protester said. They held up an orange fluorescent banner but had it angled away from both the president and the pool, so unclear what it said. <br> <br> “I agree with you, I’m working on it, man, give me another five days. Folks, you all know what they’re talking about. There should be no private prisons period. Private detention centers. They should not exist. And we’re working to close all of them,” Biden said. “I promise you,” he added. <br> <br> <b>Nikki Schwab</b><br> Senior U.S. Political Reporter<br> Washington, D.C.<br>  <img alt="Description: Description: Description: Description: pastedGraphic.pdf" height="42" src="attachments/image001.png"> <b>MailOnline </b><b>| London | New York | Hollywood | Washington</b> <br><br>T: ▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊<br> E: ▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊<br> <br> <br>  <b>Disclaimer</b><br> This e-mail and any attached files are intended for the named addressee only.
