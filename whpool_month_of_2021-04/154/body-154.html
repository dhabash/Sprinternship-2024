<div><div><div>Biden spoke for a few minutes at the top of his Oval Office meeting starting at 2:27 pm. He says he has spoken to the Governor of Minnesota and local authorities regarding yesterday's shooting. He's yet to speak with Daunte Wright's family, but he says they remain in his prayers.</div><div><br></div><div>"I think we got to wait and see what the investigation shows. The entire investigation."</div><div><br></div><div>Biden says he watched the "fairly graphic" body camera footage from the officer who killed Wright. </div><div><br></div><div>"The question is whether it was an accident or intentional? That remains to be determined."</div><div><br></div><div>Biden then stressed that there is "absolutely no justification for violence" in protest or otherwise. "Peaceful protest is understandable. And the fact is that we do know that the anger, pain and trauma that exists in Black community in that environment is real, serious, and consequential. But that does not justify violence..."</div><div><br></div><div>Biden continues: "We should listen to Dante's mom who is calling for peace and calm."</div></div><div><br></div><div><div>When asked by a reporter if he should direct federal resources to the area, Biden says there are already resources directed toward Minnesota in preparation for the results of the ongoing trial of Derek Chauvin, the police officer involved in the death of George Floyd. </div><div><br></div><div>When asked if he expects the country is on a "razor's edge" Biden says he is "not going to speculate now. I hopeful that there will be an outcome that will be supported by a vast majority of people in the region and that is my expectation."</div><div><br></div><div>When asked if he wanted to remark on infrastructure, Biden said he is "prepared to negotiate as to the extent of the infrastructure project as well as how we pay for it."</div><div><br></div><div>He cited access to water and broadband as infrastructure.</div><div><br></div><div>"That's what we're talking about. And I'm confident that everything is going to work out for us," Biden said, to some laughter from the room.</div><div><br></div><div>He quickly shot down the idea that his meetings across the aisle were "window dressing."</div><div><br></div><div>Pool was then quickly ushered out of the Oval at 2:30 p.m. As always, check remarks against the cable feeds for typos etc., which are sure to be coming very soon.</div><br></div> </div>
