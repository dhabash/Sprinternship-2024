<div>VPOTUS's motorcade arrived at Laconia Municipal Airport at 4:28 p.m. Your pooler hurried out of press vans in the hope of getting that elusive Q&amp;A, but VPOTUS made a beeline for her aircraft and didn't stop. She did not acknowledge or answer any questions from the pool today.We hopped back in vans to get to a more distant part of the tarmac where our air-chariot awaited. Your pooler saw AF2 taxiing at 4:39 but didn't see wheels-up.<div><br></div><div> Paper-bag dinner on the flight home is Mexican food. The cabin interior of "Pool Force One" (Two?) smells like Taco Bell as we lift off at 4:49 p.m.</div><div><br></div><div>Unless we pass VPOTUS in the air again, we won't see her on the ground at JBA. Expect a final note when we land nonetheless.<br> <p><b>______________________________</b></p> <p><b>David Martosko</b></p> <p>White House correspondent<br><i>DailyMailTV</i><br>Senior Content Executive<br><i>ZENGER NEWS</i><br>▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊<br>@dmartosko</p></div></div>
