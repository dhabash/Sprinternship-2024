  <div> Dr. Jill Biden was escorted into the room -- First Choice Community Healthcare, South Valley Medical Center, computer printed paper signs everywhere saying the name -- by Dr. Will Kaufman and Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham. </div> <div> <br> </div> <div> Biden had changed into a purplish cloth mask with pink butterflies (some kind of pattern, hard to tell). </div> <div> Lujan Grisham had changed into what looked like a white K-95 mask. </div> <div> <br> </div> <div> <div>Dr. Kaufman started out by thanking them for coming, said it had been a hard year. Talked about the outreach the center is doing to fight health inequities and get the vaccine to many communities. "People are tired but people are hopeful, you know and to be able to be part of this, the amount of work that we do is a little bit different to get patients here for a vaccination. We do a huge amount of outreach as a community health center, calling patients bringing them in giving them resources to make sure they get here, and our incredible teams work overtime and work weekends so that they can get here but, but you know it's really, it's really our passion. We're so excited you’re here.</div> <div><br> </div> <div>Gov. Lujan Grisham: "Can I brag about you, Dr. Kaufman? They are a lynchpin in our equity, and it's one of the reasons that New Mexico's leading in diversity and equity investments, making sure that all minority communities have investment, leadership, just like you're seeing right here." <br> </div> <div><br> </div> <div>Dr. Kaufman went on to thank the governor for the support community health centers get from the state. </div> <div><br> </div> <div>Kaufman: "Thank you, governor. I think it's actually, to me that's the core of hat community health centers are -- is really combating to eliminate health disparities. And so that's something that is what we need to do but we can't do that alone, right? If we’re going to eliminate health disparities, we have to have partners, and the state has just been an unbelievable partner. We were in those discussions months before the vaccine got here, to be able to say what do we need to be able to vaccinate our patients, and the state has an incredible job of setting up the infrastructure to do two things: speed, that can get people done fast, but then US equity that we can do that, We can do that extra level. And it's just been, it's been a real joy for us to be able to have that chance."</div> <div><br> </div> <div>Biden asked if it was all nurses doing the injections. Kaufman said it was a mixture of nurses, nurse practitioners, medical assistants. </div> <div><br> </div> <div>To the first woman, Biden said, "So I've had this shot and it doesn't hurt. I promise. Normally I’m scared of them. I have to say, it’s, like, so fast! Are you a little scared? Are you a little anxious?"<br> </div> <div><br> </div> <div>"Yeah. I’m scared. I’m nervous," said the woman, wearing a blue button down. </div> <div><br> </div> <div>Biden walked over. "You’re scared? Do you want me to come stand with you? I'll stay with her." The woman maybe said she can't look at the needle in her arm (hard to hear).</div> <div><br> </div> <div>"I can't look either. Look at me," said Biden. "It doesn't hurt. Really. It's mostly in your head." </div> <div><br> </div> <div>"I know," said the woman. </div> <div><br> </div> <div>"You all right? Look at me," said Biden. </div> <div><br> </div> <div>"All done." said the vaccinator. </div> <div><br> </div> <div>Biden applauded as did the rest of the room. "She did a great job!"<br> </div> <div><br> </div> <div>Gov. Lujan Grisham: "Thank you for making New Mexico safe. Thank you, from the bottom of my heart."<br> </div> <div><br> </div> <div>As Biden walked over to the second woman, Viviana Galvez, who works in patient registration, the vaccinator (in a white and black horizontal striped shirt), said. "She would like somewhere else to pray to." </div> <div><br> </div> <div>"All right! Can I crash?" said Biden, jaunting over. Either she or the vaccinator told Viviana (in all black except for a black and white scarf). </div> <div><br> </div> <div>"So why did you decide to come? You felt a duty? Did you have any hesitation?" Biden asked her. </div> <div><br> </div> <div>"I did. I was hesitant a little bit," said Viviana. "I mean, I didn't know what was going in my body. And I'm doing them for the community, my family..."</div> <div><br> </div> <div>"Right, that's what we want for you," said Dr. Biden </div> <div><br> </div> <div>Viviana continued, "... and for myself. Let's get those numbers going down guy. No more lives to lose."<br> </div> <div><br> </div> <div>"Okay, are you ready? One two three little poke! Good job," said the vaccinator. </div> <div> <br> </div> <div>"That was it? That was quick!" said Viviana. Biden cheered: "Yay! You did it!" </div> <div><br> </div> <div>She walked over to see if she could help the last person, a man, who was getting vaccinated, but he'd already gotten his shot. </div> <div><br> </div> <div>"Thank you very much for coming. We appreciate it," she told him. <br> </div> <div><br> </div> <div>"Tell all your friends," said Lujan Grisham. </div> <div><br> </div> <div>"Yeah, bring your friends back and tell them how easy it was," said Biden </div> <div><br> </div> <div>Viviana Galvez told the cameras (please check this), "Muy facíl, todos vengan a First Choice para sus vaccinos." (Very easy, everyone come to First Choice for their vaccines.) <br> </div> <div><br> </div> <div>"Yes!" said Biden, at least seeming like she understood the Spanish. </div> <div><br> </div> <div>They then walked to the front of the room where there was a basket of buttons and a roll of stickers to give out. I believe they were yellow, one of the NM state colors. </div> <div><br> </div> <div>"I'll do the buttons," said Biden. "I'll do the stickers," said Lujan Grisham. </div> <div><br> </div> <div>Some people were not done with their waiting / observation period after getting their shots and couldn't go to the front of the room, so Lujan Grisham asked if she could walk around and pass out stickers. </div> <div><br> </div> <div>She said things like: </div> <div><br> </div> <div>"Thank you from the bottom of my heart for getting vaccinated, you are courageous and incredible, and a good public high steward."</div> <div><br> </div> <div>"Thank you so much for your leadership. I appreciate you." </div> <div><br> </div> <div>Dr. Kaufman ended by praising Lujan Grisham's leadership and belief in science, and telling Biden that her visit and the work of the administration gave him hope. </div> <div>"I just want to say one quick thing to the both of you. We have as healthcare providers, and as New Mexicans. We want to thank you Governor for leading us through this time. And my daughter told me this morning that she just feels so proud to have somebody so strong and so smart and so dedicated to science as she is to be leading us and we are so grateful and that has kept us hopeful through this time. And Dr. Biden for you to be here is such a sign of hope for us now. And all that the administration is doing for all of us, for community health centers, so that we can continue to fight against health disparities to eliminate health disparities. We're so hopeful into the future because of all that you and the administration are doing. Thank you so much."</div> <div><br> </div> <div>"Let's keep working together," said Biden. <br> </div> <div><br> </div> <div>Pool was ushered out as Biden walked around saying good hello to two women who were working on ipads to register patients. </div> <div><br> </div> <div>"Hi Brandy, I'm Jill," was the last thing I heard. </div> <div><br> </div> <div>Again, full transcript and audio here (always check quotes). </div> <div><br> </div> <div><a href="https://otter.ai/u/zIYhHWCFOYaA6Cl1LckVblMb57I" id="LPlnk">https://otter.ai/u/zIYhHWCFOYaA6Cl1LckVblMb57I</a><br> </div> <br> <br> </div> <div> <div> <br> </div> <div> <div> <div> --</div> <div> Jada Yuan</div> <div> Features Writer, The Washington Post</div> <div> cell: ▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊</div> <div> ▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊</div> <div> Twitter @jadabird</div> </div> </div> </div>
