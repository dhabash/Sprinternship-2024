  <div> <div> <div>Final stretch to Window Rock, dozens of cars are pulled over filming and waving at the motorcade. One group of a dozen flew an American flag. </div> <div><br> </div> <div>At the Navajo Museum, Library and Visitors Center there are impressive red rock formations. A tribal police officer stood watch atop one. </div> <div><br> </div> <div>Dr. Biden first greeted Navajo Nation President Jonathan Nez then First Lady  Phefelia Nez who is wearing traditional Navajo moccasins with leg wrappings and a traditional silver and turquoise necklace and concha belt. This was in the visitors center lobby, where the walls are white and decorated with an orange stripe surrounded by turquoise. </div> <div><br> </div> <div>She then went into the library and met with nine Navajo women also dressed in colorful traditional outfits with moccasins. Please see wire photos. One wore a face mask reading “Strong Resilient Indigenous.”</div> <div><br> </div> <div>They went into the library. First Lady Nez spoke from prepared remarks then Second Lady Dottie Lizer spoke also from prepared remarks. They were hard to hear. </div> <div><br> </div> <div>But First Lady Nez did say Dr. Biden was instrumental in developing the cancer center on the Navajo reservation and particularly a specialty care center that has seen so much need they’re going to have to expand.</div> <div><br> </div> <div>Second lady Lizer thanked Dr. Biden for taking the time to spread the message about the needs of Navajo children, women and the elderly. She mentioned issues of domestic violence and the need to have education</div> <div> about healthy eating, obesity and diabetes. </div> <div><br> </div> <div>Dr. Biden spoke to the group. (Apologies if this comes out garbled, I’m having weird formatting on my email!). Many thanks to CNN’s Kate Bennett for transcription help. </div> <div> <div><br> </div> <div>I want to thank you for your heartfelt words. I really felt what you said. I’m aware of many of the problems you’re taking about because of my staff and also because of I have an interest in the Navajo Nation and I’ve been here. I had hoped that maybe you were going to say the cancer center was just perfect, that it was enough. But now that you need to expand it, that’s... that’s going to break my heart. So many of my own family members have been victims of cancer and so... But I certainly will take that back and you’re right. We are all mothers and activists and women who care about our families and our community and I think it is right that we work together, that i hear your voices, and I hear your message and I take your message back with so the people that need to hear what you’re going through, what your challenges are. I want to thank you for opening up your hearts and your thoughts me. I look forward to hearing what you have to say. <br> </div> </div> <div><br> </div> <div>We are holding as she speaks privately with the women and will head to her radio address next. </div> <div><br> </div> <div><u>Additional color from the road: </u></div> <div><br> </div> <div>We drove through Gallup (pop. ~22,000), which is the most populated area we’ve seen. </div> <div><br> </div> <div>Signs on the road included:</div> <div><br> </div> <div>Several advertisements for fireworks and accident attorneys.</div> <div><br> </div> <div>“America Need Jesus, Now More Than Ever” </div> <div><br> </div> <div>A Seventh Day Adventist church with a sign asking, “Will you be ready when Jesus returns?”</div> <div><br> </div> <div>And “Hell had no exit.”</div> <div><br> </div> <div>Thanks to the local reporters from the Navajo Times, USA Today, and the AP who helped with color. </div> <div><br> </div> <div>Sent from my iPhone<br> </div> <div> <div>Jada Yuan</div> <div>Political Features Writer, <i>The Washington Post</i></div> <div>▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊</div> <div>C: ▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊</div> <div>Twitter: @jadabird</div> <div>IG: @alphajada</div> </div> </div> </div>
