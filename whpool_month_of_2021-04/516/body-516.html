<p>The motorcade arrived at the venue at 2:26pm. We are set up outdoors on top of rail road tracks, surrounded by stationary Amtrak trains. A lectern is set up between the train tracks with signage that says “Getting America back on track/50 Amtrak/The future rides with us.” POTUS is due to deliver remarks soon marking the 50th anniversary of Amtrak. They will be streamed but I will send additional color.-- </p><div><div>Morgan Chalfant<div>White House correspondent, The Hill</div><div>▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊</div><div>▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊</div></div></div>
