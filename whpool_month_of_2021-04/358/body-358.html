  <div> <div> Good afternoon from sunny Albuquerque. The pool overnighted here at <a href="https://www.hauntedrooms.com/new-mexico/albuquerque/haunted-places/haunted-hotels/hotel-parq-central" title="https://www.hauntedrooms.com/new-mexico/albuquerque/haunted-places/haunted-hotels/hotel-parq-central">Hotel Parq Central</a> and Dr. Biden spent this morning virtually teaching. Yesterday's 4/21 visit was to a vaccination center, First Choice Community Healthcare, in Albuquerque's majority-Hispanic South Valley district. </div> <div> <br> </div> <div> The pool has been tested for covid-19 in preparation for the First Lady's two-day visit to Navajo Nation. This entire three-day trip to New Mexico and Arizona is her longest solo trip as first lady. </div> <div> <br> </div> <div> She'll be going by car from Albuquerque to Window Rock, Arizona, the tribal capital -- about a 2-hour, 45-minute drive northwest of Albuquerque and just west of the New Mexico border. Pool is spending the night in Gallup, NM, a thirty-minute drive back over the border. </div> <div> <br> </div> <div> The visit is meant to "highlight the Administration's commitment to standing with the Navajo Nation and all of Indian Country," according to her office. </div> <div> <br> </div> <div> Today there will be a welcoming ceremony at 5pm with President Jonathan Nez and other tribal leaders. She and First Lady Phefelia Nez will meet with Navajo women, then Dr. Biden will give a live radio address to Navajo Nation in front of the red sandstone arch after which the tribal capital is named. It's also the site of a veteran's memorial the tribe established. According to the timing, she may be giving the speech as the sun sets behind her, which should make for a dramatic setting. </div> <div> <br> </div> <div> Tomorrow morning (4/23) she will attend a listening session with students from across Navajo Nation at a boarding school, then will visit a vaccination site. After having the country's highest per-capita coronavirus rates, nearly half of the Navajo Nation population is vaccinated, far higher than the national average. </div> <div> <br> </div> <div> This is Dr. Biden's third trip to Navajo Nation, but her first as first lady. She last went in 2019 to celebrate the opening of a cancer center on the western side of the reservation. Her first visit was in 2013 to deliver the commencement address to Navajo Technical University. She has a longstanding relationship with President Jonathan Nez. </div> <div> <br> </div> <div> <b><u>BACKGROUND FROM FIRST LADY'S OFFICE</u></b> </div> <div> <br> </div> <div> <p> Today, Thursday, April 22, the First Lady will begin her two-day visit to the Navajo Nation.
