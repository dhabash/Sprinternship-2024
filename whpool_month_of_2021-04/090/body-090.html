 <p> <br> <b>President Joe Biden joined a call of faith leaders at 12:15 hanging up at 12:28. </b><br> <br> Quick overview: No big news here. Biden called into the Zoom meeting and a stock photo of the president appeared on the screen as he spoke. <br> <br> The major thrust here is Biden acknowledges a resurgence of Covid and recognizes he needs faith leaders to urge skeptical communities to receive the vaccine and to not get too “cavalier” when traveling and abiding by Covid safety measures like mask-wearing.<br> <br> “They're going to listen to your words, more than they are me, as president of the United States “ Biden told the leaders they could talk to their congregations “about what we have to do, what's available and not to be fearful, not to be fearful of getting the vaccine.”<br> <br> Biden also noted that because he and family had been vaccinated he may be able to see family members on Easter. <br> <br> More quotes TK <br> <br> <br> <br> Natasha Korecki<br> White House Reporter<br> POLITICO<br> ▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊ <br> @natashakorecki <br> <br> </p>
