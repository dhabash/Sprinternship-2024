  <div> <div> <div>Motorcade left hotel at 9:08am. </div> <div><br> </div> <div>A man stopped in a driveway to the highway stood outside his red pickup pickup truck and waved. </div> <div><br> </div> <div>Two other people still in front of a couple of stacks of bales of hay (a sign said “hay”) and waved. The landscape is rolling hills, sand and sage colored, with low brush and what look like juniper and piñon trees. There are very few dwellings but a few scattered trailers here and there (and some cluster of trailers), and a few permanent structures — small buildings with pitched roofs — with mostly pickup trucks outside. A convenience store called Speedy’s advertised “Fireworks! 50% off all year!”</div> <div><br> </div> <div>Another ministry had a sign reading “Hell Has No Exit. Heaven is the Only Door.” (The hell part was in red dripping letters and the heaven part in white.) There was another sign from some kind of Baptist church reading, “Jesus saves from the wrath of god.” </div> <div><br> </div> <div>Kids played on a jungle gym near a colorful hand painted sign reading “Welcome to Navajo Nation.”</div> <div><br> </div> <div>We drove through Window Rock (site of yesterday’s visit), which is a true town with stores.</div> <div><br> </div> <div>Near the school was a cluster of trailers, some of them collapsed or abandoned. </div> <div><br> </div> <div>The school about 5 buildings in dusky pink stucco, one story, spread across several hills. </div> <div><br> </div> <div>Navajo fire department in uniform were standing in a line to greet her by their trucks. Dr. Biden exited her car and spoke with them for about two minutes.</div> <div><br> </div> <div>On the fence outside the school were handmade poster board signs advertising Pfizer and Moderna vaccines. One read, “Welcome First Lady Dr. Jill Biden.” </div> <div><br> </div> <div> <div>Sent from my iPhone</div> <div>Jada Yuan</div> <div>Political Features Writer, <i>The Washington Post</i></div> <div>▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊</div> <div>C: ▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊</div> <div>Twitter: @jadabird</div> <div>IG: @alphajada</div> </div> </div> </div>
