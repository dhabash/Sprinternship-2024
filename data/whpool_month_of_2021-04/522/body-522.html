  <div>The roundtable kicked off at<a href="#"> 12:47pm</a> and ended at 1:33pm. VP Harris took five questions from the pool before exiting the room at 1:38pm. Topics included COVID in India, pushing the expanded definition of infrastructure, her approach to broadband, and whether the Brent Spence Bridge will get funding from the American Jobs Plan. I’ll send out her answers shortly — nothing groundbreaking.  <div> <div> <div> <br> </div> <div> Some color from the roundtable: </div> <div> <br> </div> <div> It began with Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) saying VP Harris “has made such a difference as vice president, already.” Harris said of Brown, “Whether the cameras are on or off, he is the same person.”</div> <div> <br> </div> <div> The event featured Sen. Brown moderating a discussion between VP Harris and five participants. Everyone sat, masked, around a table inside the 1819 Innovation Hub at the University of Cincinnati.</div> <div> <br> </div> <div> VP Harris said she views public transit in the context of, “Let’s just start with making it doable. Can they raise their families? Get to work? Get to the grocery store?” She said the American Jobs Plan would allocate $110 billion for transit agencies to build on “what you’re doing here in Cincinnati.” VP Harris also said investing in public transit will help fight climate change.</div> <div> <br> </div> <div> Some quotes/notes from the roundtable participants:</div> <ul> <li> Darryl Haley, SORTA CEO, said, “Public transit is about connection...it’s also about connecting to higher paying jobs.”</li><li> Jill Meyer, Cincinnati Regional Chamber of Commerce: “When people can make choices, we know that they can access better jobs.” She said $1 spent on transit = $3 in economic impact. “Where transit is accessible is where development happens.” </li><li> Eddie Koen, Urban League, encouraged the Biden/Harris Administration to “really think about transit from a racial equity lens” and build on what they’re already doing.</li><li> Troy Miller, Amalgamated Transit Union Local 627, said a lot of his members contracted COVID while working, but they’ve recently been using city busses to get members vaccinated. </li><li> Vikas Mehta, University of Cincinnati, said transit “is social, it is psychological.” He talked about the importance of accessibility to bus stops for families and improving infrastructure like sidewalks so people can get around safely. </li></ul> <div> VP Harris said the American Jobs Plan has “substantial money set aside for training” workers to adapt to clean energy transit jobs. She added that organized labor will be key in facilitating the training.</div> <div> <br> </div> <div> Asked by Sen. Brown why people who don’t rely on public transportation should care about investing in it, SORTA CEO Darryl Haley said, “Even if you yourself don’t use public transportation, the people you count on count on public transportation.”</div> <div> <br> </div> <div> VP Harris closed by saying it was an “insightful conversation” about infrastructure, which she called a “fancy word for how do you get to where you need to go?” </div> <br> <div> <div>Taylor Popielarz</div> <div>Spectrum News Washington Reporter</div> <div>▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊</div> <div>@TaylorPopielarz</div> <div><br> </div> Sent from my iPhone</div> </div> </div> </div> The contents of this e-mail message and <br>any attachments are intended solely for the <br>addressee(s) and may contain confidential <br>and/or legally privileged information.
