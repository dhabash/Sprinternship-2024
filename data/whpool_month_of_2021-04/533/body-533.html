 <p> ﻿AF2 touched down at Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport at 11:31am after a somewhat bumpy flight, thanks to the wind. VP Harris deplaned at 11:49am and was greeted by Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear (D). The motorcade then rolled to a nearby building so VP Harris could meet the Beshear family and other KY officials, as pool holds in press vans (list from WH): </p><blockquote> - Britainy Beshear, First Lady of Kentucky<br> - Will Beshear, son of Governor Beshear<br> - Lila Beshear, daughter of Governor Beshear<br> - Michael Brown, Secretary of the Executive Cabinet of Kentucky<br> - La Tasha Buckner, Chief of Staff to the Governor of Kentucky<br> <br> </blockquote> We’ll soon be en route to the 1819 Innovation Hub at the University of Cincinnati, where VP Harris will participate in a roundtable discussion about public transit and the economy that will be moderated by Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio). It will be streamed live on the White House website and is scheduled to begin around 12:25pm. (We have a 20-min drive there) During the flight, Symone Sanders came back and spoke/took some questions: - This Cincinnati stop is part of the “getting America back on track tour” as administration officials travel to a dozen states. Roundtable will focus on the “impact and value of public transit.” - American Rescue Plan allocated $110 billion for public transit and the American Jobs Plan would allocate $85 billion for it.<br> - VP will also discuss efforts to expand broadband access, which she’s helping lead. Accessibility and affordability are two focuses for that. $100 billion in American Jobs Plan for broadband. “This is extremely important to the administration.” <br> - On approach to Northern Triangle: “We are really trying to figure out the best way to engage.” VP hasn’t engaged yet with leaders in Honduras and El Salvador, not to say she won’t. Senior admin officials are working with government leaders and community leaders there. <br> - Today’s roundtable will show “how the federal government can partner and work with local leaders to help build more vibrant communities.”<br> - Kentucky/Ohio’s Brent Spence Bridge “could potentially be one of those projects” that receives funding from the American Jobs Plan if it gets passed (10 bridges in America will be chosen)<br> Taylor Popielarz Spectrum News Washington Reporter ▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊ @TaylorPopielarz Sent from my iPhone The contents of this e-mail message and any attachments are intended solely for the addressee(s) and may contain confidential and/or legally privileged information.
