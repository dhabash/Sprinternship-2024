<p>The First Lady was greeted in the beginning by the executive director of the James Rushton Early Learning Center. She thanked FLOTUS for coming, but it was difficult to hear behind the masks how the First Lady responded. Here are the quick remarks from the executive director — <a href="https://otter.ai/u/wTO2-0TAALL5T_hpce6Yg8qhcS4" target="_blank">https://otter.ai/u/wTO2-0TAALL5T_hpce6Yg8qhcS4</a> </p><div><br></div><div>FLOTUS stood in front of a bright blue sign that read, “Welcome First Lady Dr. Jill Biden.” </div><div><br></div><div>Press was then moved into a Pre-K classroom where about a dozen children, ages 4 &amp; 5, sat around four small tables, all wearing masks. “I can’t believe there’s so many people here!” one exclaimed. A few others waved to press and staff. </div><div><br></div><div>“Welcome To The Owls Pre-K Dr. Biden!!” is handwritten with marker on the whiteboard. </div><div><br></div><div>FLOTUS walked in shortly after, at 11:22am CST. The kids were squealing with delight and shouting “hi” as she waved. </div><div><br></div><div>The executive director introduced Congresswoman Sewell and the Birmingham major first. “[Rep. Sewell] helps us get things we need for our school, so that’s really cool,” she said before introducing the First Lady, saying that she is a teacher. </div><div><br></div><div>“I’m Jill, nice to meet you,” the First Lady introduced herself. </div><div><br></div><div>Rep. Sewell added, “She’s also the First Lady. Isn’t that so cool?”</div><div><br></div><div>FLOTUS then sat down on a tiny chair next to one table of students, who were performing a science experiment. She took a pipet herself and worked on the science experiment, which is a lesson in chemical reactions, herself. </div><div><br></div><div>Press was escorted out at 11:32am CST. </div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div> <br><div><div><br></div></div></div> -- <br><div><div><table><tbody><tr><td><p><img alt="A on ▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊" height="57" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/ZdGW9ao1vPzFTi62HUYc7iDeUiLR2mI1Y5a_zLukCEQL2LGDVziQA9815OGcIojiBeJZtP7HPc9g3WJ6H-ImsET2tIdaE0SsdiPriZA5MuC3nNZubmWDaaLB7TmVEuEQq6m1-HA2"></p></td><td><p>Sarah Mucha</p><p>Politics Reporter</p><p>▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊ | ▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊</p></td></tr></tbody></table><br></div></div>
