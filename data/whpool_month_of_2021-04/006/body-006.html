  <div> <div> <div> <p> Connectivity was poor at Military OneSource.</p> <p> FLOTUS entered a conference room at Military OneSource at 1:36 PM ET. She was briefed by Erika Slaton, Associate Director, Outreach and Engagement, Military Community Support Programs, Department of Defense Military Community and Family Policy.</p> <p> "We have master's level consultants that are available 24/7 by phone, and live chat, and one of the top requested services through Military OneSource is spouse employment, followed by non medical counseling for those everyday and military life issues, and then our tech services", Ms. Slaton said.</p> <p> The First Lady was afterwards played a call recording from a service member seeking non medical support through Military OneSource. Your pooler took a photo of the call transcript, as shared by the Office of the First Lady. It can be downloaded here: <a href="https://we.tl/t-DeJSv4Ezvm">https://we.tl/t-DeJSv4Ezvm</a></p> <p> FLOTUS was escorted to a second location, where a large poster read “Military OneSource. Connecting you to your best MilLife”. Ms. Slaton explained that her staff are experts in disabilities and providing directions to military families. She told FLOTUS about a family of six, with children diagnosed with autism, who were helped during transition. “She was struggling because her husband wasn’t there”, she said, and therapy was approved for their children.</p> <p> “I heard so much the past few years about children with special needs and parents who don't know where to go”, said FLOTUS. She thanked the staff for the work they do and said: "These families are desperate, they don’t know what to do or where to go."</p> <p> Alyson Urrego (U-RAY-GO), Health and Wellness Coach, ValueOptions Federal Services, joined later and gave examples of how they help military families to succeed through their programs with healthy eating, meditation, daily journaling.</p> <p> FLOTUS also listened to the testimony of Kimberley Ferrara, a military spouse who is pregnant and needed to relocate, look for childcare and opportunities. “I am a person whose life has changed” thanks to the services of Military OneSource, she pointed out.</p> <p> Pool and FLOTUS moved to a third location, where the call center is. Jill Bianco, Manager of Call Center Operations, ValueOptions Federal Services, said their main responsibility is to make sure resources are explained to military members.</p> <p> U.S. Army service member specialist Alekzandr Cattanach (ALEK CAT-UH-NACK), shared his testimony to FLOTUS. He said to have a hard time adjusting to military life and wanted counseling outside the line of command. He got military behavioural help through Military OneSource and found them very “supportive”. The transition was "seemless" thanks to its professionals, he added. FLOTUS asked if he had gone to counseling alone. “I started going alone and then I went to marriage counseling with my wife”, he responded.</p> <p> FLOTUS then greeted a few consultants who are working from home and joined virtually through a computer monitor. “Thank you team!”, FLOTUS said. She asked if they will come back to the office and where they are located. “It will be a fase approach for people to come in”, Ms. Slaton said as she explained that Military OneSource has two offices in Virginia and one in Washington state.</p> <p> Dr. Biden asked if she could approach some of the staff members working on site. She talked to three of them. She jokingly asked to one of them if a faux flower that she had on her desk was a real daffodil and they both laughed. The call center staff members said that now is a busy season because it is tax season and they have a tax program. They also noted that they have received several calls regarding wellness and family support. FLOTUS asked if they have used the programs themselves. The said no. "Thanks for helping our military members and their families ... and making their lives easier”, FLOTUS said.</p> <p> The First Lady left the room at 2:02 PM ET. Pool was scorted out at 2:12 PM ET.</p> <p> We were lights and sirens back to the White House and arrived at 2:21 PM ET after an uneventful motorcade ride. Your pooler did not see FLOTUS walking into the White House.</p> <p> Your pooler took some photos of FLOTUS during the tour that can be downloaded here: <a href="https://we.tl/t-QJJ613QYfq">https://we.tl/t-QJJ613QYfq</a></p> <p> A photo of a Military OneSource informational leaflet that your pooler was given can be downloaded here: <a href="https://we.tl/t-GJTRqMGq4j">https://we.tl/t-GJTRqMGq4j</a></p> <p> That’s a wrap, folks!
