 <p> Burlington Mayor Miro Weinberger was followed by Lt. Gov. Molly Gray.<br> <br> “I think the most important thing is, as we come out of this pandemic and as we complete our recovery, that we have a more equitable system,” Gray said.<br> <br> The lieutenant governor highlighted the need for increased affordable access to broadband for Vermont’s rural and aging population. Vermont ranks as one of the oldest states in the nation, Gray added, with a majority of rural and aging counties experiencing “more deaths than births”.<br> <br> “We’ve been talking about broadband all over the country, we talked about it, (Gov. Scott) and I, beforehand about how important it is,<br> especially the relationship between broadband, rural communities and health,” Emhoff said.<br> <br> “As rural facilities close down or become less available and we’re relying more on telehealth and internet health and there is no broadband, how are we going to handle that problem?”<br> <br> Lt Gov. Gray was followed by Gov. Phil Scott, sitting next to Emhoff. The governor spoke briefly about the state’s track record during the pandemic, as Vermont has had one of the lowest number of COVID-19 deaths and cases in the continental United States.<br> <br> “We’re one big city here in Vermont and that’s why we’re so successful, because everyone is doing their part and we’re all just spokes in the wheel,” said Scott. <br> <br> The governor finished his remarks by encouraging both Emhoff and Vice President Kamala Harris to visit Vermont for vacation at some point in the near future. <br> <br> “I grew up in New Jersey and I use to come skiing at Stratton and Killington several times a winter,” Emhoff said. Stratton Mountain Resort and Killington Ski Resort are popular skiing and snowboarding destinations both located in the southern half of Vermont.<br> <br> “My dad somehow back in the 60s decided to get these little kids skiing,” he added. “He laced up my little boots, strapped me in my little wood skis. The lessons were basically they’d pushed me down the mountain and say ‘don’t fall’.”<br> <br> The second gentleman went on to praise Vermont’s efforts to manage the COVID-19 pandemic.<br> <br> “You in Vermont, the leaders here--state, local and federal--are showing the way in how we can all do this,” Emhoff said. <br> <br> <br> <b>From: </b>"Bhattacharya, Megha EOP/OVP" &lt;▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊&gt; <b>Date: </b>Wednesday, April 21, 2021 at 11:22 AM <b>To: </b>"Bakuli, Ethan" &lt;▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊&gt; <b>Subject: </b>RE: Press pool reports for 4/21/21 Burlington visit<br> <br> Perfect, thank you!<br> <br> <b>From:</b> Bakuli, Ethan &lt;▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊&gt; <b>Sent:</b> Wednesday, April 21, 2021 11:18 AM <b>To:</b> Bhattacharya, Megha EOP/OVP &lt;▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊&gt; <b>Subject:</b> [EXTERNAL] Press pool reports for 4/21/21 Burlington visit<br> <br> Second Gentleman Doug Emhoff arrived at Community Health Centers of Burlington at 11:08 am.<br> <br> He arrived in time to see Bishnu Subedi, a recent New American resident living in the Burlington area, receive her first dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine. <br> <br> Subedi spoke briefly with Mr. Emhoff about the importance of getting vaccinated, and why she hoped others would follow in her steps.<br> <br> “These shots, they work, they’re painless,” Emhoff said. <br> <br> “ I want to be a part of ending this pandemic and that’s why I’m getting vaccinated,” said Subedi, 28, who arrived to the United States from Nepal in March of this year. <br> <br> As Subedi received her vaccination, Emhoff encouraged her that it would be alright.<br> <br> “I did it twice, it’s all good,” he said. <br> <br> <br> Get <a href="#"> Outlook for iOS</a><br> <br> </p>
