 <p> <br> <br> After leaving the WOW Hall vaccination clinic, Emhoff headed to the Hult Center for the Performing Arts Center in downtown Eugene, Oregon, arriving at 2:12 p.m. Monday, April 5, 2021. He convened a roundtable discussion with DeFazio, Eugene Mayor Lucy Vinis, along with representatives from pro bono legal groups in Oregon and local individuals impacted by COVID-19. <br> <br> Emhoff used the roundtable to listen and take notes he promised to bring back to Harris, hearing from Shandel DeLille, a Lane County resident who was evicted twice in 2020, and recalled waiting 16 weeks for unemployment benefits after losing her job of 23 years, only to be denied. <br> <br> The second gentleman thanked her for sharing her story, and promoted Biden’s American Rescue Plan, saying it would serve as a “stop-gap” for crisis situations across the country.<br> <br> “Unfortunately it’s a story you see playing out all over the country,” Emhoff said. “Folks who never expected to be in that situation, losing their home, losing benefits, even losing eating. There’s folks who never thought they’d be in a food line, you see those pictures, miles long.”<br> <br> Representatives from Oregon Legal Aid Services, Sexual Assault Support Services and the Lane County Legal Aid office of Oregon Law Center all took turns discussing changes and challenges they have faced since the pandemic set in. <br> <br> The conversation ended with a discussion of homelessness in Lane County, and about fears of the upcoming end to the CDC’s eviction moratorium at the end of June. BB Beltran, executive director of Sexual Assault Support Services, said she believes the number of people requesting her group’s services will only increase with the end of the moratorium. <br> <br> “For our survivors, I would characterize their situations as precarious at best before the pandemic, and now it’s very unstable,” Beltran said. “I anticipate survivors reaching out about the moratorium, probably more than we can handle.”<br> <br> Erika Hente, managing attorney from Lane County Legal Aid, added that while some unhoused people have money to move into a house, the problem is that there’s a lack of housing.<br> <br> Emhoff responded to the concerns by saying he would take concerns like the eviction moratorium, the lack of housing, and bring them back to the White House. He closed by saying the Biden administration is working hard to address the many issues.<br> <br> “You’re seeing the immediate results, there’s shots, there’s checks, there’s thought to the future,” he said. “You’ve got an administration that’s all over this, and we’re doing everything possible to address these issues.”<br> <br> <br> </p>
