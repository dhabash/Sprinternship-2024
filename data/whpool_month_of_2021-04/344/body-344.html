 <p> I’ve been informed by the Press Office that President Biden’s climate remarks will now be taking place sometime slightly after 9:18 AM when they were scheduled to start. <br> <br> Our pool gather time was pushed back from 9:00 AM to 9:20 AM. I’m told they don’t have an exact time Biden will start speaking now, but I will share all further updates as I get them. <br> <br> Emilie Munson<br> Washington Correspondent<br> Hearst Newspapers<br> Cell: ▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊<br> Twitter: @emiliemunson<br> <br> </p>
