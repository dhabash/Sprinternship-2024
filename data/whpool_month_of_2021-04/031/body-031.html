 <p> Please check against audio: <br> <br> Biden spoke to Neighborhood Health workers seated at a white table where people check in for their shot. He asked roughly how many people a day come through, to which an official said about 300 people a day. <br> <br> Overall, Neighborhood Health has administered about 20,000 doses, or about 5,000 shots a week, the official said. <br> <br> At that point, POTUS leaned over and whispered to the workers: "We passed 150 million yesterday," he said. <br> <br> Approaching three people receiving a shot near where pool was held, POTUS said: "You're doing the right thing...really important. And when you go back, when you go home, get all your friends, tell them, 'Get a shot when they can,'" he said. "We're going to be able - everyone's going to be able to before the month is out. Every age." <br> <br> “All these strains you're hearing about. You should not worry,” he said. “They are more virulent. They are ...more dangerous but the vaccines work on all of them."<br> <br> "Hopefully we're going to get good enough, pretty soon, where we have enough that we can give the rest of the world. Because this is something that's not just... we can solve it here in America. We don't solve it around the world - you can't build a wall or fence high enough to keep out a virus," he said. <br> <br> Asked if the worst of the coronavirus pandemic was behind us, POTUS said: “I think If everyone continues down the road that we’re on now, it will be behind us but it’s not over yet. We’re in a situation where I believe by end of the summer, we’ll have a significant portion of the American public vaccinated.”<br> <br> <br> <br> <br> Courtney Subramanian<br> White House correspondent<br> USA TODAY<br> ▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊<br> @cmsub<br> <br> <br> <br> </p>
