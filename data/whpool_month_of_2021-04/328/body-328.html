Hassan as an advocate for universal broadband access. <br><br>No major news, but highlights are below.<br><br>VPOTUS compared the push for universal broadband to congressional action in 1936 to fund nationwide electrification: "The idea was pretty basic: Not everybody in America had electricity. And it was really clear that without electricity you couldn't function. You couldn't participate at an equal level. You couldn't be competitive. The quality of life would be so compromised. And so we said as a country: 'Hey! No, this is everybody in it together. We all have to participate in making sure everyone has the basic services that are necessary to raise their families, participate in society and be productive.'"<br><br>She laughed: "Many of us grew up with -- you know, we had to do our homework and if you needed help you went to the Encyclopedia Brittanica. Those days are over! Now you've got to have access to the Internet!"<br><br>She spoke briefly but mostly inaudibly in the face of a stiff wind about broadband's impact on small business. Your pooler caught the words "access and affordability." <br><br>"Think about our seniors. The pandemic made so clear that some of our most vulnerable, those that need healthcare the most, can't get to a doctor. But we have this thing called telemedicine where you can get diagnosed, you can get treatment -- *if*if you have access to broadband."<br><br>VPOTUS said massive amounts of money are being spent to bring "affordable access to broadband to everyone. It's the same thing that our country decided to do in 1936, saying 'Let's get electricity to everybody.' And rural America should not be left out of that priority." ...<br><br>"the emphasis on co-ops, the emphasis on nonprofits, the emphasis on efforts that are being led by the community. And so that's why we're here today: To see it. To see it and understand. This is really an incredible moment in our history."<br><br>VPOTUS turned to the racks of transformers and asked Steve Camerino: "What are we looking at?" Camerino told her they were electric transformers and fiber optic cables.<br><br>VPOTUS went back to Jeff Bird for a minute-long conversation, even quieter than before and closer to him. Nothing was audible. She chatted with Camerino and then walked back inside the Co-op building for a meet-and-greet listening session that is closed to the press.</div><div><br></div><div>VPOTUS took no questions from reporters. We have yet to get face-time or a gaggle today.<br><br>Your pooler is sending this dispatch from inside the parked pool van where VP staff was kind enough to bring some pizza. Our van driver spotted a bald eagle circling overhead.<br><br>When VPOTUS wraps up inside we'll be on the road again, headed toward Concord, N.H. for an event at an apprenticeship training center run by the International Brotherhood of Electric Workers. Expect that transit to be another 45 minutes.<br><br><br><br>e<br></div><div><br></div> <p><a name="m_6139256492773969286_m_3108290787797741180_m_-2272735963939942249__MailAutoSig" rel="noreferrer noreferrer"> </a></p> <p><b>______________________________</b></p> <p><b>David Martosko</b></p> <p>White House correspondent<br><i>DailyMailTV</i><br>Senior Content Executive<br><i>ZENGER NEWS</i><br>▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊<br>@dmartosko</p></div></div> </div>
