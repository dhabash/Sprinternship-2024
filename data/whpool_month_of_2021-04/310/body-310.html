  <div> <div> <div>Your pooler is using the drive back to Albuquerque to tie up odds &amp; ends of last three days. </div> <div><br> </div> <div>Soon after the brief stop, the motorcade pulled off the highway and onto an Old Route 66 two-lane road, possibly to avoid construction. There is a really great looking bike path alongside it. Now back on highway. </div> <div><br> </div> <div>For people who wanted to know which Flying J truck stop FLOTUS entered on Thursday, it’s the one in Continental Divide, NM, 19 miles from Gallup, NM. </div> <div><br> </div> <div>CORRECTION to report #5, President Nez had told President Biden to nominate Roselyn Tso to bigger role in the Indian Health Service, NOT Bureau of Indian Affairs. </div> <div><br> </div> <div>He also thanked President Biden for making a “major disaster,” not an “emergency” declaration. “We appreciate the force, within days after the inauguration, signing the major disaster declarations for Navajo Nation, which brought in more resources.”</div> <div><br> </div> <div>Here’s the Nez exchange via otter </div> <div><br> </div> <div>NEZ RE: ROSELYN: I’ve been asking your husband to nominate her put her in a position at the Indian Health Service.<br> </div> <div><br> </div> <div>BIDEN: I happen to know that!
