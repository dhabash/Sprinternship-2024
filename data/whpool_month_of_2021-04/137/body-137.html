<div>At approximately 2:30, the pool was led into the Oval, where BIden was seated with his back to the fireplace, with Vice President Harris on his right and members of the CBC, spaced before him on the parallel couches and then in chairs, leading up to the Resolute Desk. Susan Rice and Cedric Richmond stood in the back, behind the crush of cameras, boom mics and reporters. Everyone was masked.<div><br><div>POTUS waited for the pool to enter and began his remarks by noting "the loss that you have had" and then mentioned the passing of longtime CBC member Rep. Alcee Hastings, who he "knew for a long long time." He then spoke of the "God awful shooting" of Daunte Wright in Minnesota, "which resulted in his death" before referencing the trial for the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis.</div><div><br></div><div>I have 93.5% confidence in the following bolded quotes but did not get them all, as the sound was suboptimal through Biden's black mask and I positioned myself poorly. If you're a 100 percenter, wait for the transcript or watch the feed.</div><div><br></div><div><b>"We're in the business, all of us meeting today, to deliver some real change. And when we took office, and I talked to Jim (Clyburn) about this, every single aspect of... signed an executive order...every single aspect of our government...every agency has a primary focus of dealing with equity. It's not a joke...."</b></div><div><b><br></b></div><div><b>"We also have an awful lot to deal with... in advancing economic opportunity...."</b></div><div><b><br>"So I look forward to discussing all these priorities..."</b></div><div><b><br></b></div><b>"I'd like to take some special time in American Jobs Act, which I think some of you actually helped me put that together with the ideas he gave me earlier on.<br><br>"And I think we can make significant, significant changes in the last legislation and help the past, reduce child poverty and reduce poverty black communities significantly just by that act alone. But my objective there is to make this change."</b><div><b><br>"And so, anyway, lot to talk about, and I'm looking forward to having this meeting with the Congressional Black Caucus...."</b></div><div><br></div><div>After speaking for about two minutes, the president indicated that his audience with the pool would be terminated. <br><br>But the pool -- collectively and individually -- had other ideas and began shouting questions. Through the sheer persistence of a radio reporter, one query seemed to cut through, or at least the last part of it did, which I can clearly hear on my tape: <b>"(</b>unintelligible)<b>...there will be change in the way that African Americans interact with police in this country during the Biden era. What can you deliver on, sir?"</b></div><div><br></div><div>Biden (fortissimo): <b>"A lot. And I will tell you guys later. Let's go."</b></div><div><br></div><div>The pool, at this point, disaggregated, with some following the verbal and nonverbal cues from the wranglers to quit the Oval. As a result, your pooler did not hear the precipitating question on vaccines, but got most of the response: </div><div><br></div><div>Biden: <b>"My message to the American people on the vaccine is, I told y'all. I made sure we have 600 million doses of the MR (unintelligible), not of either Johnson and Johnson and or AstraZeneca. So there is enough vaccine, that is basically 100% unquestionable, for every single, solitary, American. Thank you."</b></div><div><br></div><div>As the pool was (again) being ushered out, more questions were essayed -- "Mr. President, what's your message for President Putin on Ukraine?" -- but they were not met with a presidential response. <br><br>The pool exited the Oval around 3:41 and a travel photo lid was called shortly thereafter. </div><div><br></div><div>There has not been an announcement overhead that the CBC meeting has concluded. <br><br></div></div><div>h</div><div><br></div></div>
