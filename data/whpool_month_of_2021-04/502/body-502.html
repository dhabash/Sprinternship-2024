  <div>﻿The AF2 pilots deserve credit for landing the plane at JBA in quite the windstorm at 4:38pm. Turbulence throughout the flight was intense and when we made contact with the runway, the plane veered from side to side enough that we all applauded the pilots for the safe landing.</div> <div><br> </div> <div>After we landed, VP Harris came back to the press cabin for a brief OTR — lasted maybe 3 mins. </div> <div><br> </div> <div>VP deplaned at 4:49pm and hopped in her motorcade at 4:51pm. A WH official says she is motorcading to the Vice President’s Residence, rather than lifting because of wind.</div> <div> <div><br> </div> <div>That’s it for your travel pool. Thanks to co-poolers Kelly O’Donnell and Tim Perry for helping transcribe throughout the day. </div> <div> <div> <div> <div><br> </div> <div>This first-time pooler appreciated the opportunity.
