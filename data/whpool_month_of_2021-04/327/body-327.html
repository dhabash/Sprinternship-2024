 <p> The briefing concluded at 12:45 PM.<br> <br> At the conclusion, Press Secretary Jen Psaki announced she had cookies made by her mother-in-law to share with the press corp. Press Assistant Angela Perez handed out the homemade chocolate cookies to the grateful press in the briefing room. My personal review is they’re really delicious! <br> <br> Emilie Munson<br> <i>Washington Correspondent</i><br> <b><i>Hearst Newspapers</i></b><br> Cell: ▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊<br> Twitter: @emiliemunson<br> <br> <br> </p>
