<div><div>POTUS wore a dark suit, white shirt and blue and red striped tie. The words 'Leaders summit on climate' were written in white on a blue backdrop.<br><br>He began: "Good morning to all our colleagues around the world. To world leaders taking part in this summit, I thank you. Your leadership on this issue is a statement to the people of your nation and people of every nation, especially our young people, that we're ready to meet this moment.<br><br>"And meeting this moment is about more than preserving our planet. It's also about providing a better future for all of us. That's why, when people talk about climate, I think jobs. Within our climate response lies an extraordinary engine of job creation and economic opportunity ready to be fired up.<br><br>"That's why I proposed a huge investment in American infrastructure and American innovation, to tap the economic opportunity that climate change presents our workers and our communities, especially those too often left out and left behind.<br><br>"I want to build a critical infrastructure to produce and deploy clean technology, both those that we can harness today and those that we'll invent tomorrow. I talk to the experts and I see the potential for a more prosperous and equitable future. <br><br>"The signs are unmistakable. The science is undeniable. The cost of inaction keeps mounting. The United States isn't waiting. We are resolving to take action. Not only our federal government but our cities and our states, all across our country, small businesses, large businesses, large corporations, American workers in every field."<br><br>More to follow.<br></div><div><br></div><div>-- <br><div><div><div><div><div><div><div><div><div><div><div><div><div><div><div><p>David Smith<br>Washington bureau chief<br>Guardian News &amp; Media<br>-----<br>▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊<br>▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊<br>▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊<br>-----<br>twitter: @SmithInAmerica<br>------<br><img height="77" src="external_files/external_img02.png"></p><p>▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊<a href="http://theguardian.com/" target="_blank">theguardian.com</a></p><p>-----<br>Download the Guardian app for<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.guardian&amp;hl=en_GB" target="_blank"> Android</a> and<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/the-guardian/id409128287?mt=8" target="_blank"> iOS</a><br>-----</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><br></div></div> <br> <div><hr></div><div>This e-mail and all attachments are confidential and may also be privileged.
