  <div> <div> <div>We arrived at the Hunters Point Board School at 9:38am.</div> <div><br> </div> <div>The listening session is in the common room of a dorm with a Navajo patterned rug on the floor and a mural of a red rock known as Hunters Point with Navajo words that translate roughly to “Doing It On Your Own,” according to one of the students here. Navajo music is playing softly. Students sit in a large distanced circle wearing traditional outfits with turquoise and silver jewelry, wrapped moccasins, and wrapped hair buns. A poster on the wall is titled The Seven Grandfather Teachings, such as Honesty and Respect. </div> <div><br> </div> <div>This school is K-5. The five students present were high school aged and not from this school. Two teachers were present. </div> <div><br> </div> <div>Pool was not present for FLOTUS’s greeting. </div> <div><br> </div> <div>She is wearing a mid-length black, green, and white patterned dress, black blazer and navy heels as well as a silver and turquoise necklace and a pin that may have some significance.</div> <div><br> </div> <div>FLOTUS entered at 9:54am</div> <div><br> </div> <div>TO ROOM</div> <div><br> </div> <div>Good morning, how are you? </div> <div><br> </div> <div>Did you thaw out from last night? </div> <div><br> </div> FIRST LADY NEZ</div> <div><br> </div> <div>To the students here. You know this is going to be one of those days you're going to remember for the rest of your life.</div> <div><br> </div> <div>FLOTUS TALKING TO STUDENTS </div> <div><br> </div> <div>** she told them that she was texting with her own students this morning because they have final exams, that she feels at home in a school. </div> <div><br> </div> <div>** when she said that her students have lost family members in the pandemic, like she suspected the people present had, one of the teachers nodded </div> <div><br> </div> <div>** she told the students to write a journal about the pandemic so they can describe it to their children. She also told this to elementary students in New Hampshire on her trip there at the start of this Help is Here tour </div> <div><br> </div> <div><b>Transcript from otter </b></div> <div><br> </div> <div>Thank you. Firstly, so I'd like to say good morning to everyone to to the students and the teachers and the principal, and, and of course to the press and thank you for being here. I am a teacher, and I've been teaching 36 years. So I feel right at home here in this school.<br> <div><br> </div> <div>And so actually I was on my phone this morning with, with a lot of my students because we're going through final exams now. So they were doing their outlines for their final exam so I was texting with students this morning already. And so, I just love being here and listening to you.<br> </div> <div><br> </div> <div>And this semester has been so hard. Hasn’t it? It’s been so hard. And I don't know what your plans are for your school but we’re hoping to go back at my school — I teach at a community college. And so we're hoping to be back on campus, like in the fall. And I said to my students, you know, “How are you making out?” and they said, “oh we're just hanging on. We're just hoping, you know, we're back on campus.” And that's exactly how I feel. And because a lot of my students, like, probably some of you have lost family members, they've had to deal with not only a lot of loss in their lives, but this has been so different learning over, zoom, and, and trying to connect and feel that sense of community that I think teachers create in classrooms that is so important.<br> </div> <div><br> </div> <div>And if I could say anything, and this is what I tell my own students. If you could — I'm a writing teacher which is going to be obvious pretty soon. [laugh] But If you could write a journal. And just look at this time, don't forget it, and think about what did you learn about yourselves. You know, were you stronger than you thought? Were you, maybe it was harder than you thought. Did you change in some way? Did you find that you were kinder, or did you find that you, you know, maybe felt sad so many days? So write this. Write it down. Because when you have your own children, and you tell them about the pandemic of 2020 and 2021, and they say to you, “but Mom What was it like? what was it really like?” Because you can't really explain, right? The masks and the washing our hands and the distancing, they're not gonna understand it. But if you, if you can pull out your journal. And remember how you felt, I think it's gonna be so important, and it's actually going to be history for your family about what this time means.<br> </div> <div><br> </div> <div>So I want to thank you all for being here. You know I feel right at home. I just feel right at home in a school, and I try to visit schools and teachers and students wherever I go because I want to learn your journey, I want to learn more about you and what you're doing, and your hopes, your aspirations and where you'll build from here. So, so I guess I'll hand it over to... who am I handing it over to? <br> </div> <div><br> </div> <div>Teacher Leslie began speaking, said she went to state college near Willow Grove, Pennsylvania and FLOTUS said, “oh willow grove!”</div> <div><br> </div> <div>Pool was ushered out at 10:01am and will not be listening to the discussion. </div> <div><br> </div> <div><br> </div> <div><br> </div> <div> <div>Sent from my iPhone</div> <div>Jada Yuan</div> <div>Political Features Writer, <i>The Washington Post</i></div> <div>▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊</div> <div>C: ▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊</div> <div>Twitter: @jadabird</div> <div>IG: @alphajada</div> </div> </div> </div>
