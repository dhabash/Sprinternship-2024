  <div> The First Lady came on stage at 11:35 PM ET and waved at the large screens while greeting the over 100 guests that joined virtually the Joining Forces event. She looked on one of the screens for Ryzun Hazen, a senior military kid at Ramstein High School in Germany, who kicked off the event. He fondly recalled how he met President Biden and the First Lady earlier this year and discussed the peculiarities of the life of military kids. He introduced the First Lady afterwards.</div> <div> <br> </div> <div> FLOTUS wore a purple blazer and skirt with a white blouse, tan shoes and three golden necklaces with several pendants.</div> <div> <br> </div> <div> Dr. Biden thanked Hazen and complimented him for adapting to his life in Germany. She described him as an "open and funny and sincere" kid. "It's that resilience a heart that makes military kids like you so special", she said.</div> <div> <br> </div> <div> FLOTUS started by recalling the christening ceremony for the USS Gabrielle Giffords and compared that ship to "the entire armed forces": "This ship will be steady in the harshest way, strong enough to cut through the most violent seas, able to withstand any storm. And yet, so much of its power is unseen beneath the waves". "You may not wear a uniform, but you serve a huge sacrifice for us all", the First Lady said about military families.</div> <div> <br> </div> <div> She noted that this work is personal to her because her dad was a Navy signalmen in World War II and went to college on the GI Bill. She also mentioned how her son Beau joined the Delaware Army National Guard. She felt "the unique pull of both incredible pride and concern".</div> <div> <br> </div> <div> "You are the rudder that steers our military and supporting your physical, social and emotional health is a national security imperative", said the First Lady to military families.</div> <div> <br> </div> <div> FLOTUS laid out the goals of the Biden Administration for military families as follows:</div> <div> <br> </div> <div>1) "We're going to focus on military family, employment and entrepreneurship. Before the pandemic, the Department of Defense, estimated that the military spouse, unemployment rate was about 22%. Spouses, all of you deserve, opportunity to do the work you love, whether that means keeping your job when you move from base to base or owning your own businesses. And we need to make sure that you can get quality childcare, when you need it, so that you don't have to feel like you're choosing between your job, and taking care of your kids. We're going to work on education for military children."</div> <div><br> </div> <div>2) "There are more than 2 million kids whose parents are service members National Guard reservists, or veterans, our schools want to support all students, but they don't always know how to do so. We're going to work with educators and our government partners to make sure that you are military connected kids have what you need to succeed."</div> <div><br> </div> <div>3) "We're going to work on military family health and well being. Just 1% of our country has shoulder the burden of 20 years of war. No one has more strength and grit and resilience in our military families, but you can't do this alone. We have to help you carry this weight by improving access to mental health resources, ensuring everyone can put food on the table, and supporting caregiving families and survivors. So far, we already have commitments from the Department of Defense, Labor and Education. And this is just the beginning. Our effort will take all of our government working together, and we expect every agency to step up and be part of it."</div> <div><br> </div> <div>FLOTUS ended her remarks at 11:48AM ET.
