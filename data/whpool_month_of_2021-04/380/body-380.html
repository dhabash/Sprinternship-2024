  <div> <div> <div> <p> Wheels down at 1:18pm MST at Albuquerque International Sunport.</p> <div> Bumpy at takeoff from JBA, bumpy just before ABQ and 2 other bumpy spots, but otherwise smooth, uneventful flight. There was a slight problem with attaching the stairs to the exit of the rear of the plane, causing some delay in disembarking. We flew over a blanket of clouds that cleared up around the plains, and descended to clear views of desert landscape: sandy hills, the Sandia mountains covered in dark trees. <br> </div> <div> <br> </div> <div> It is sunny with clear skies and a dry temp of 61 (high of 75) here in Albuquerque. </div> <p> &gt;From now on, pool reports will be in Mountain Standard Time. (Remember we will have three days of pool reports from this trip.) </p> <p> We are headed to a nonprofit health center in Albuquerque that has been administering COVID-19 vaccinations. </p> <p> At 1:40pm FLOTUS was met on the tarmac by New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham, Albuquerque Mayor Tim Keller, recently-elected Rep. Teresa Leger Fernandez (whose district covers the northern part of the state including Santa Fe), and the tribal council vgovernors of three Pueblos (Sandia, Isleta, and San Felipe) located near Albuquerque, among others. See full list below. </p> <p> Lujan Grisham is wearing an iridescent coat and a yellow and red face mask, like the NM flag. FLOTUS chatted with her for a minute. She spent a minute or so talking with everyone. She spent a particularly long time chatting with the governor of San Felipe who was wearing a turquoise and silver bolo tie. </p> <p> FLOTUS greeted Gov. Lujan Grisham first and then everyone else in the order listed below. Most of the time she stood in place as they came up to greet her in turn.</p> <p> Will have interview with Leger Fernandez to send you.</p> <p> FLOTUS got into car at 1:49pm. </p> <p> Background note from your pooler: Secretary of the Interior Deb Haaland was the Congresswoman representing Albuquerque and the surrounding area before her cabinet appointment. There will be a special election to replace her in June 1, 2021. </p> <p> While in the air, President Biden made his address about reaching 200 million vaccine shots nationwide in fewer than 100 days in office. See video of speech for more. Dr. Fauci followed on CNN talking about the need for young people to get vaccinated and the dangers of asymptomatic transmission. Both Biden and Fauci talked about the problem of U.S. vaccine supplies outstripping demand. Officials in Columbus, Ohio, held a briefing on the police shooting.
