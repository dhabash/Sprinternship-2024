<p>VPOTUS and Governor Newsom were given a tour of the water treatment facility. For the first part of the tour, their conversation with David Briggs, Director of Operations and Maintenance, EBMUD, who was conducting the tour, was not audible over the water moving at the treatment plant. <br><br>It’s pretty much exactly what you’d expect of a water treatment plant - asphalt, cement, pipes, water.<br><br>“Maybe because I’m a kid from California,” VPOTUS said, she thinks more about drought and water policy. She asked two people who’ve worked as apprentices at the facility to tell her about how their work helps address that. They discussed how they have helped provide water to fight wildfires. The governor asked how they’ve adapted to dealing with power outages. Harris said she’d be telling their stories, including that they are members of a union, all around the country. The VP’s office identified the apprentices as Nalani Heath-Delaney, Carpenter, EBMUD and Walter Coty, Construction Inspector, EBMUD.<br><br>Speaking with Angela Glover Blackwell, founder of PolicyLink later in the tour, she spoke about human infrastructure in addition to physical infrastructure: “it’s also about building up the skill set of America’s workers.” For example, she said, “that literally is part of the infrastructure of any working family - the caregivers,” she said. “It’s all connected.”<br><br>But then she started talking about equity issues around water treatment and, shaking her arms in the air to show excitement, jokingly apologized to Newsom: “I’m just going to continue to geek out on water.”<br><br>She addressed the pool at the end, starting by saying she was glad to be home in Oakland.<br><br>“We must understand the equities and inequities of distribution and access to clean water especially clean drinking water, and address it in a way that is about supporting what governments must do at a local at a state and federal level, understanding the opportunities here and this is a big part of the American Jobs Plan, which is the opportunity to not only build back up our infrastructure around water and water policy .... part of our reason for being here to advance is the issue of water equity, whether you're talking about Iowa, where I spent a lot of time, and places in the Midwest where people have wells in their backyard and sewage systems on their property. It is on their property it is there, but it is eroding and they don't have the resources to actually upgrade and make it safe. And so part of our policy is to say give grants, give support to homeowners to be able to upgrade their systems because of course this is a public health issue. We are looking at it in terms of places like Flint, the Mississippi Delta.” She spoke about the need for more union jobs and for lead pipes to be replaced to stop water contamination and the health effects of lead in water.<br><br>In comments that will be relevant to a governor facing a recall, she turned to Newsom and said, “I especially want to thank you Governor. He and I have worked together for a long time we were elected to our first office, same time. Back in 2003, and one of the things I know is that Gavin has always been a champion about what we need to do around our environment, and he and I have had many conversations over the years in particular about preservation of water. And so I'm just so happy that you've been able to join us, governor.”<br><br>Newsom started by saying “you don't need to educate the Vice President on water policy and what a gift that is for us particularly out here in the state of California.” He spoke about the well below average results of the annual snowpack survey and the water shortages likely to come. Referring to the administration’s infrastructure proposal, he said, “I know we're prone to hyperbole, it's a game changer, to complement the efforts that are happening at the local level to address the needs here in the East Bay system that was designed in the 1930s that needs investment needs upgrade.”<br><br>Rolling to the next stop at 11:18.<br><br><br><br><br>——<br>Edward-Isaac Dovere<br>The Atlantic<br>@IsaacDovere<br><br><br></p>
