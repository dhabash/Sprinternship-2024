  <div> Interview conducted on the tarmac at ABQ Sunport before visit to vaccine center. </div> <div> <br> </div> <div> Rep. Teresa Leger Fernanez was wearing a turquoise shiny jacket with a gold pattern and a brightly colored pink mask that looked like a Mexican weaving. </div> <div> <br> </div> <div> She said the jacket was made by an Indigenous designer to mimic a pottery design and the mask was a reflection of her Latina heritage. </div> <div> <br> </div> <div> <u>Re: the jacket</u></div> <div> <br> </div> <div> I'm the chair of the Committee on Indigenous People, and she's going out to a Native American reservation and what we know is that we are going to look at structural racism and addressing those inequities, the communities that are most is Native Americans, they are the most we have failed in that process. I wanted to bring this to honor, you know, the fact that she's going there.  <br> </div> <div> <p><br> </p></div> <div> <p><u>The mask</u></p></div> <div> <p> The mask is I'm also Latina, and so I wanted to make sure we highlighted the fact that, you know, I met with the president yesterday with the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, met with the president and vice president, and they were so committed to addressing systemic racial inequity. And they understand the issues around the Latino community because this is my identity. It's like honoring, you know, I'm Latina. I work for Native American tribes that she's on their land right now. </p> <p> <u>The airport is on indigenous land</u></p> <p> This airport, we always say in New Mexico, we often recognize the fact that these are lands that were originally had by Indigenous people. And then in New Mexico, there has been such a, you know, the Spanish community, intermarriages. I myself am a little bit of everything. I'm a 17th generation New Mexican. So I have a little bit of everything in me. </p> <p> <u>What her trip means</u></p> <p> And it means a lot to have her come because it's a recognition that all of these communities matter, and that rural communities matter, the fact that she's going out to a rural community. Also I want everybody to know what the American rescue plan is doing. So it's doing everything from the shots in the arms to what it's going to doing in the rural community and on Navajo land. And that, I think is key, is we need to keep reminding us, this is the work we're doing. </p> <p> I'm glad to be here because Congress passed the American rescue plan. We are working on the American family plan and the jobs plan because without that, we don't come out of this, not just build back better, but for some places it's never been built. Like for some places on the Navajo reservation, it's not building back better, it's building it for the first time. So that's what we really need to get done. And by her coming and bringing that attention. I mean, nobody else can do that. And she's bringing that attention to it. </p> <p> <u>Praise for her love of education</u></p> <p> And then her love of education. I'm daughter of educators ... We need that as a nation to make sure that we are constantly allowing children to have the miracle of falling in love. I really appreciate it. </p> That's it, have a good night everyone. </div> <div> <div> <br> </div> <div> <div> <div> --</div> <div> Jada Yuan</div> <div> Features Writer, The Washington Post</div> <div> cell: ▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊</div> <div> ▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊</div> <div> Twitter @jadabird</div> </div> </div> </div>
