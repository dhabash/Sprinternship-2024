 <p> <br> <b>Pool is now being summoned to gather before 1:15 Cabinet meeting. </b><br> <br> Here are Biden remarks to faith leaders. <br> <br> This is run through Otter and tried to go through and fix some. If anyone needs something specific, please let me know. <br> <br> Some highlights of Biden remarks: <br> <br> “The point I'm trying to make is for the faith community as faith community leaders, you've been critical partners to us in our COVID response. <br> <br> We need you to spread the word, let people in our communities and your community know how important is to get everyone vaccinated when it's their turn, and soon they'll just be able to just line up and just get their name on a list.<br> <br> And that's how we're going to defeat this virus and that's how we're going to come together again in our communities, in our houses of worship.<br> <br> What I'm worried about now what the scientists are telling me, people are getting too cavalier with traveling a great deal, gathering in larger crowds and people aren't wearing their masks. Aren't on social distancing. Aren't washing their hands. And you've seen this spike. <br> <br> “I think this is the Godly thing to do. Protect your brother and sister.” <br> <br> <br> <br> Natasha Korecki<br> White House Reporter<br> POLITICO<br> ▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊ <br> @natashakorecki <br> <br> </p>
