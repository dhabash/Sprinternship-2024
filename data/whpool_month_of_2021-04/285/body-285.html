 <p>Japanese Prime Minister Suga's vehicle (black van) arrived at the doors of the West Wing at 1:32 pm <br> <br>He came out from the vehicle 10 sec later. He was greeted by the Chief of Protocol. <br> <br>I believe the Presidents (at least in the case of George W. Bush and Barack Obama whom I covered) usually do not greet foreign leaders as they arrive at the West Wing, with the exception of President Trump. <br> <br>A military honor cordon lined the both sides of the drive way.<br><br> <br> Best regards,<br><br>  Taka Abe <br><br>**************************** <br>Takaaki Abe<br>Deputy Bureau Chief <br>Nippon Television <br> Washington DC News Bureau<br>  ▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊ (Cell) <br>▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊ (E-mail)  </p>
