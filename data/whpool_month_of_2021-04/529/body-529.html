 <p> ﻿VP Harris’ motorcade arrived at the 1819 Innovation Hub in Cincinnati at 12:31pm after an uneventful 28-minute drive from Kentucky along an empty Interstate 275. A few onlookers watched the motorcade roll by and shot pictures/video on their phones while standing outside their workplace or in parking lots. Along a stretch of Interstate 471, several people got out of their cars and took photos while standing in the median.  As we arrived at the hub, several dozen observers were gathered outside, including some Trump supporters complete with flags and signs. You can watch the roundtable here (so detailed notes will not be sent along): <a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=jYVZoWZY_wM&amp;feature=youtu.be">https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=jYVZoWZY_wM&amp;feature=youtu.be</a> Participants, per WH: </p><blockquote> - Chairman Sherrod Brown (D-OH) (moderator)<br> - Darryl Haley, SORTA CEO<br> - Eddie Koen, President and CEO, Urban League<br> - Vikas Mehta, Professor, Fruth/Gemini Chair, Ohio Eminent Scholar and Urban Design Certificate Coordinator at the University of Cincinnati<br> - Jill Meyer, President and CEO of Cincinnati Regional Chamber of Commerce<br> - Troy Miller, President/Business Agent, Amalgamated Transit Union Local 627<br> <br> </blockquote> Also, I’m tweeting various photos throughout the trip @TaylorPopielarz.
