 <p> First pool report from Louis Krauss, Eugene Register-Guard<br> <br> <br> <br> <b>Second Gentleman Douglas Emhoff visited Eugene, stopping at the White Bird clinic at WOW Hall Monday, to emphasis the importance of everyone in the community getting a COVID-19 vaccination. </b><br> <br> <b>Emhoff , the husband of Vice President Kamala Harris, entered the WOW Hall vaccination site at 12:57 p.m. Monday, April 5, </b> <b>and toured the venue with Oregon Gov. Kate Brown.</b><br> <br> <b>White Bird Clinic, which provides </b>crisis services and free medical care in Lane County, partnered with WOW Hall in early March to offer COVID-19 vaccinations to all who are eligible. The  <b>community center and live music venue in downtown Eugene</b>, which is owned and operated by the nonprofit Community Center for the Performing Arts, is set up <b>with tables to administer shots and 20 chairs spaced out for people in their observation period after getting their COVID-19 vaccine. </b><br> <br> <b>Emhoff watched as Christina McClory, a registered nurse who volunteers with White Bird, administered a vaccine to a visitor to the clinic. </b><br> <br> <b>“It’s fast, painless, and it’s going to save the lives of your community,” Emhoff said, thanking McClory for letting him observe.</b><br> <br> <b> “Everyone should bring attention to this. We’re so close. “</b><br> <br> <b>He then made comments with Brown, who thanked the administration for its response to COVID-19 and getting vaccines distributed so far. </b><br> <br> <b>Brown emphasized the need for equity in response to COVID-19.</b><br> <br> <b>“We know our communities of color have been disparities impacted disproportionately, and we have to do everything we can to put justice and equity at the center of our work.”</b><br> <br> <br> <br> <br> ------------------------------<br> Michelle Maxwell<br> Managing editor, The Register-Guard<br> <br> RG Media Company<br> ▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊<br> Email: <a href="mailto:▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊" target="_blank"> ▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊</a><br> Office: ▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊ <br>Twitter: @MichelleAtTheRG Facebook: <a href="http://www.Facebook.com/MMaxwell2014" target="_blank">www.Facebook.com/registerguard</a><br> <br> <br> </p>
