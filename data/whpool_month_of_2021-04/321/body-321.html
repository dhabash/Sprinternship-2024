Told "no," she laughed: "That would have been fun!"</div><div><br></div><div>VPOTUS described the union labor that installs this equipment as "brains and brawn. More brains than brawn."</div><div><br></div><div>After hearing Ms. O'Connor's story about leaving a career as a concert sound engineer to become an electrician, VPOTUS asked her what she gets out of her union. The answer was about having weekends off, plus a pension.</div><div><br></div><div>"Union jobs are good jobs. Period," VPOTUS said.
