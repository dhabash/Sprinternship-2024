"Broadband access and affordability isn't a luxury. It's really essential. And we learned that during the pandemic, when the need for broadband access grew significantly," she said.<br><br>Hassan said a New Hampshire teacher told her one of her students had to drive to a school parking lot to get online. She praised Congress for appropriating state broadband infrastructure aid "that was fairly unrestricted." <br><br>Hassan said the goal should be "to make sure we are getting that reliable high-speed broadband to people in this country no matter where they live, no matter what they earn."<br><br>Steve Camerino, president and CEO of the New Hampshire Electric Co-op, spoke briefly -- and quietly -- facing VPOTUS and not the pool. (The wind, the social distance and the masks are conspiring to cover a lot of sound, and your pooler left his boom mic in his other jacket...)<br><br>Camerino asked for more "federal action" on broadband. "There are areas where the density is too low for investor-owned companies to go," he said, adding that rural Americans are "going to fall behind" in access to education, telehealth and commerce.<br><br>"We need your help and we really appreciate the help provided so far," he told VPOTUS.<br><br>Jeff Bird read brief remarks from a piece of paper. He got flustered at one point and VPOTUS walked toward him to reassure him: "We don't know what you know! You're teaching right now." <br><br>VPOTUS pointed her arm toward the press pool and suddenly got sotto voce as she got within a foot of Bird. She told him: "All these guys, they may or may not understand what you do. What you do is so important." She said again: "These people, they don't understand."<br><br>The pool here includes a reporter from the Manchester Union-Leader. <br><br>Report on VPOTUS remarks coming up.<br><br></div><div><br></div> <p><a name="m_-5437812070381520706_m_-5900177736503311307_m_1922834204879016857__MailAutoSig" rel="noreferrer noreferrer"> </a></p> <p><b>______________________________</b></p> <p><b>David Martosko</b></p> <p>White House correspondent<br><i>DailyMailTV</i><br>Senior Content Executive<br><i>ZENGER NEWS</i><br>▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊<br>@dmartosko</p></div></div> </div>
