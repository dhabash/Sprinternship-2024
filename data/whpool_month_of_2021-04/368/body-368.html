<div><div>POTUS continued: "We know just how critically important that is because scientists tell us that this is the decisive decade. This is the decade we must make decisions that will avoid the worst consequences of the climate crisis. We must try to keep the earth's temperature to an increase of 1.5 degrees Celsius.<br><br>"The world beyond 1.5 degrees means more frequent and intense fires, floods, droughts, heat waves and hurricanes tearing through communities, ripping away lives and livelihoods, increasingly dire impacts to our public health. It's undeniable – you know, the idea of accelerating and punishing reality that will come if we don't move. We can't resign ourselves to that future.<br><br>"We have to take action, all of us, and this summit is our first step on the road we'll travel together - God willing, all of us - to and through Glasgow this November and the UN climate change conference to set our world on a path to secure, prosperous and sustainable future. The health of communities throughout the world depends on it, the wellbeing of our workers depends on it, the strength of our economies depends on it.<br><br>"The countries that take decisive action now to create the industries of the future will be the ones that reap the economic benefits of the clean energy boom that's coming. We're here at this summit to discuss how each of us, each country, can set higher climate ambitions that will in turn create good paying jobs, advance innovative technologies and help vulnerable countries adapt to climate impacts.<br><br>"We have to move, we have to move quickly to meet these challenges. The steps our countries take between now and Glasgow will set the world up for success to protect livelihoods around the world and keep global warming at a maximum of 1.5 degrees Celsius. We must get on the path now in order to do that.<br><br>"If we do, we'll breathe easier, literally and figuratively. We'll create good jobs here at home for millions of Americans and lay a strong foundation for growth in the future and that can be your goal as well. This is a moral imperative, an economic imperative, a moment of peril but also a moment of extraordinary possibilities. Time is short but I believe we can do this and I believe that we will do this.<br><br>"Thank you for being part of this summit, thank you for the commitments you have made, the communities you're from, God bless you all and I look forward to progress that we can make today and beyond. We really have no choice. We have to get this done."<br><br>Pool was ushered out as POTUS sat down at a C-shaped table with John Kerry on his left and Antony Blinken on his right. Blinken spoke next, starting: "Good morning. Good afternoon. Good evening. We are so grateful to have all of you with us today. <br><br>"As President Biden and Vice President Harris have made clear, this administration intends to do more than any in US history to meet the climate crisis. What the United States can do at home can make a significant contribution toward keeping the earth’s warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius. That’s why we’re raising our ambitions, as the president described, and we will meet the new targets we set."<br></div><div><br></div>-- <br><div><div><div><div><div><div><div><div><div><div><div><div><div><div><div><p>David Smith<br>Washington bureau chief<br>Guardian News &amp; Media<br>-----<br>▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊<br>▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊<br>▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊<br>-----<br>twitter: @SmithInAmerica<br>------<br><img height="77" src="external_files/external_img02.png"></p><p>▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊<a href="http://theguardian.com/" target="_blank">theguardian.com</a></p><p>-----<br>Download the Guardian app for<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.guardian&amp;hl=en_GB" target="_blank"> Android</a> and<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/the-guardian/id409128287?mt=8" target="_blank"> iOS</a><br>-----</p><br></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div> <br> <div><hr></div><div>This e-mail and all attachments are confidential and may also be privileged.
