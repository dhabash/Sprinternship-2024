   <div>At the end of golf, the president initially came over to pool, smiling and quipping: “The course record is still intact.” <div>He then took two questions, one on Navalny and one on the refugee cap.</div> <div>Fuller quote on the latter:</div> <div> “We’re going to increase the number. The problem was that the refugee part was working on the crisis that ended up on the border with young people. We couldn’t do two things at once. But now we are going to increase the number.”</div> <div>Note that the sentences were a little garbled and also muffled by the mask the president was wearing.</div> <div>With thanks for assists from Jonathan Lemire and Tyler Pager.</div> <div> <div><br> </div> <div><br> <br> <div> <table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><b>Sebastian Smith</b></p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p><i>White House correspondent</i></p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td>@SebastianAFP</td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p>Tel: <a href="tel:▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊">▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊</a> - Mob: <a href="tel:▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊">▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊</a></p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><img alt="Agence France-Presse" height="40" src="http://signature.afp.com/logo/LogoAFP.png"></p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> Sent from my iPhone</div> </div> </div> </div>
