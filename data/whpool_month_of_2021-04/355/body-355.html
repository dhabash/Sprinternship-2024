  <div> <div> <div>Motorcade pulled out of Albuquerque hotel at 2:22pm MST. </div> <div><br> </div> <div>It’s 166 miles to our next stop. Drive time to Window Rock, AZ, the tribal capital of Navajo Nation is 2 hours and 45 mins. </div> <div><br> </div> <div>The landscape along I-40 is sandy hills covered in tumbleweeds and sage colored brush, which gives way to straw-colored flatland, then red and purple mesas and hills covered in juniper bushes with mountains in the background. Signs to exit and drive on Historic Route 66 dot the interstate outside Albuquerque. We passed an RV park and RV sales shop called Camping World, as well as a Route 66 Casino Hotel with a big sign that said, “Mask up” on one side and “Casino Open” on the other. Very few trees are taller than four feet. Also passed signs advertising fry bread on Pueblos. A small herd of cattle. A freight train. Traffic was backed up on the other side of the interstate for a few miles, maybe rubbernecking. Sky is light blue with wispy cirrus clouds. </div> <div><br> </div> <div>The interstate passes through land on the Laguna and Acoma Pueblos. It is so beautiful. (Attached a few photos for reference.) </div> <div><br> </div> <div>The welcome ceremony will be at the Navajo Nation Museum.</div> <div><br> </div> <div><b><u>MORE BACKGROUND FROM FIRST LADY’S OFFICE</u></b></div> <div><br> </div> <div> <p> GREET</p> <p> • President Jonathan Nez</p> <p> • First Lady Phefelia Nez</p> <p> • Vice President Myron Lizer</p> <p> • Second Lady Dottie Lizer</p> <p> • Speaker Seth Damon</p> <p> SPEAKING PROGRAM </p> <p> • Kee Allen Begay, Council Delegate</p> <p> • President Jonathan Nez</p> <p> • Vice President Myron Lizer</p> <p> • Speaker Seth Damon</p> <p> • Chief Justice JoAnn Jayne</p> <p> • Navajo Nation Youth Advisory Council (performance)</p> <p> • Dr. Perphelia Fowler, Navajo Division of Human Resources Director</p> <p> BIOS </p> <p> President Jonathan Nez</p> <p> Jonathan Nez is the 9th and current president of the Navajo Nation.
