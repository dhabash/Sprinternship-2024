<div> <p>The First Lady started speaking around 12:26pm CST. </p><p>“Thank you Congresswoman Sewell,” she began. “We’ve shopped together,” the First Lady added, as the audience laughed. “You helped my husband pass one of the most transformative pieces of legislation in decades.” </p> <p>“Mayor Woodfin, God, it’s so great to see you again. Thank you for welcoming me to Birmingham. My husband is so grateful for your partnership and the work that you do in this city. So thank you,” she said. She acknowledged Former Alabama Sen. Doug Jones in the audience as well and thanked him for his support of her husband. </p> <p>Biden spoke about the images from the pandemic that she won’t forget, including the "lines for food banks going on for blocks and blocks. And so many people have lost jobs and need that help, really for the first time. So many frontline workers, oh my gosh, showing up every day to keep food on our tables while their own cupboards are empty at home." </p> <p>FLOTUS acknowledged that she visited a Head Start center earlier in the day and talked about the issues facing those programs and families in Birmingham, like reduced hours, unemployment, and parents who are at the breaking point.</p> <p>"This is hard," she said, speaking directly to struggling parents. "I know that you would do anything for your child. You want to give them the world. Every parent does." </p><p>"Help is here," FLOTUS said as the audience applauded. She talked about schools reopening safely now and explained the child tax credit found in the American Rescue Plan. </p><p>The First Lady quoted Mr. Rogers, saying, "When the gusty winds blow and shake our lives, if we know that people care about us, we may bend with the wind but we won't break." She said that while the United States and Birmingham may be facing gusty winds, her husband cares about the American people. "This pandemic will not break us," she said. </p><p>Remarks as prepared for delivery will be provided shortly, but in the meantime here is an Otter, if that's helpful.
