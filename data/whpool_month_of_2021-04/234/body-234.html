  <div> <div> <div> <div>Hi there!</div> <div><br> </div> <div>The VP came off the plane and was greeted at the airport by: </div> <div><br> <div> - Administrator Michael Regan, Environmental Protection Agency </div> <div> - Governor Roy Cooper</div> <div> - Congresswoman Kathy Manning</div> </div> <div><br> </div> <div>They bumped elbows and chatted for a few minutes. Pool was under the wing of AF2 and couldn’t hear. We are now rolling to Guillory Technical Community College where the VP will give a speech on the American Jobs Plan. </div> <div><br> </div> <div>Motorcade rolled at 10:49. </div> <div><br> </div> <div>Excerpts of the speech from OVP: </div> <div> <p> “It will be the largest jobs investment our country has made since World War II. And it’s not just about jobs. It's about good jobs. But I want to break down what I mean by a "good job". In the 21<sup>st</sup> century. In America.</p> <p> I believe you shouldn't have to work more than one job to pay your bills and feed your family. One good job should be enough. At a good job, you shouldn’t have to worry about your safety at work. At a good job, you shouldn’t have to go into debt for a diploma that promises a decent paycheck. </p> <p> It's pretty simple: A good job allows people the freedom to build the life you want.</p> <p> To reach as high as you want.</p> <p> To aspire. </p> <p> Good jobs are what the President and I will create with the American Jobs Plan.” </p> </div> </div> <div><br> </div> <div> <div>-- <div> <p> Eugene Daniels | White House Reporter &amp; Playbook co-Author | <b>POLITICO </b>▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊ | <a href="http://twitter.com/EugeneDaniels2">@EugeneDaniels2</a></p> <br> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div>
