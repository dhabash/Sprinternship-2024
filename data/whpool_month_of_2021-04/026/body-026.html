 <p> <b>On Masters golf tournament: </b><br> <br> “I think that's up to the Masters.”<br> <br> “It is reassuring to see for-profit operations and businesses are speaking up about how these new Jim Crow laws are just antithetical to who we are. There’s another side to it, too. The other side to it too is when they in fact move out of Georgia, the people who need the help the most, the people who are making hourly wages, sometimes get hurt the most.”<br> <br> “I think it’s a very tough decision for a corporation to make – or group to make. But I respect them when they make that judgment and I support the judgment they make.” <br> <br> “The best way to deal with this is for Georgia and other states to smarten up. Stop it. Stop it,” he said. <br> <br> <b>On vaccine hesitancy in red states. </b><br> <br> POTUS says the Biden administration is working on a media campaign to tackle vaccine reluctancy. “And by the way the number of people who are reluctant to take it continues to diminish – continues to diminish across the country.”<br> <br> POTUS says there’s two groups that are seemingly hesitant: One group who’ve been reluctant because of “past wrongs that have been done to them” and another group who “Mitch McConnell keeps speaking to them, which I give him credit for.”<br> <br> <b>On whether he has spoken to Federal Reserve Chair Jay Powell, POTUS says he has not. </b><br> <br> “I think the Federal Reserve is an independent operation. And starting off my presidency, I want to be real clear that I'm not going to do the kinds of things that have been done in the last administration – either talking to the attorney general about who he’s going to prosecute or not prosecute and under what circumstances, or for the Fed, telling them what they should and shouldn't do. Even though that wouldn't be basis upon which I’d be talking to him. So I have been very fastidious about not talking to them but I do talk to the secretary of treasury.” <br> <br> Courtney Subramanian<br> White House correspondent<br> USA TODAY<br> ▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊<br> @cmsub<br> <br> <br> <br> </p>
