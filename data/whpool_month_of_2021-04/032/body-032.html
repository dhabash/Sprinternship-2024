<div><br><div><div><div>The people at the vaccination site for this visit, seated in spaced chairs and after receiving their shots, didn’t immediately realize that VPOTUS and the other officials had entered the room, until Mayor Lightfoot roused them by asking them to welcome the Vice President.</div><div><br></div><div>“It is good ﻿to be in the house of labor!” VPOTUS said.</div><div><br></div><div>She briefly addressed the room: “what you all are doing is so important, both for the folks who are administering vaccinations, and those who have received the vaccine. Please tell all your friends, tell your aunties and uncles, and your grandparents and kid that when it's their turn, is their time and let's all just do what we need to do to be healthy to be safe, take care of ourselves and our families, and in that way we will build back up.”</div><div><br></div><div>VPOTUS then chatted with one man getting his shot, Lucio Polanco, a 20-year, SEIU high-rise window washer receiving the Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine, and asked him about his work. Turning to the vaccinator, Osman Meah, Pharmacy Manager at Jewel Osco, she said, “How many shots a month do you do — if you had to guess? 12,000? No kidding. Wow.”</div><div><br></div><div>There was then a brief speaking program, with remarks from Gov. Pritzker, Sen. Durbin, Sen. Duckworth, Rep. Davis and Mayor Lightfoot. Most of it was praise for each other’s work and the work of other people in the room to get vaccines out. There was also much talk of the importance of labor and unions.</div><div><br></div><div>VPOTUS spoke last. </div><div><br></div><div>“So, we just celebrated the beginning of spring, and depending on your faith or what you believe in or what you think about—Passover and Easter and Ramadan. Whatever your religion or if you don't have a religion, this a moment, just because of the time of the year. And it's a moment where we feel a sense of renewal. We see the buds on the trees, we see the flowers starting to bloom, the days are longer, it’s starting to get warm. And we can see a light at the end of the tunnel. Because we've been going through so much, so much death. So much loss: loss of life, loss of jobs, loss of normalcy for our children, loss of very critical stages of their education. And a lot of folks also were isolated because we said that's what we have to do. You can’t hang out with your friends. You might have to be alone at home. And you know when people are isolated it tends to make this feel alone, like it's just us.”</div><div><br></div><div>She talked about collective work, and how organized labor is built on that sense of collective need and collective effort. Then moving into recounting her trip to the water treatment plant in Oakland yesterday and repeating a line that she thinks wars will soon be fought over water the way they were fought over oil, she said, “The jobs to build up the water infrastructure that I was looking at yesterday—that’s plumbers, that’s pipe fitters, electricians. That's what's going to build back up our infrastructure. We're talking about human infrastructure. Well Kamala, what’s that about? Human infrastructure. If you've got children or elderly relatives, you can't go to work if you don't have somebody who’s got b to take care of them. That's called human infrastructure.”</div><div><p>The VP’s office sends along this background:</p><p>Today, Vice President Harris is traveling to Chicago. She will be participating in a walking tour of the International Union of Operating Engineers Local 399 union hall, which currently serves as a COVID-19 vaccination site. She will be highlighting the importance of getting vaccinated, and the event will illustrate the strong partnerships that are making vaccination sites possible.
