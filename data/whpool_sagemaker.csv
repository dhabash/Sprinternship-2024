VP Harris deplaned at 11:49am and was greeted by Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear (D).

Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio). It will be streamed live on the White House website and is scheduled to begin around 12:25pm. (We have a 20-min drive there) During the flight Symone Sanders came back and spoke/took some questions: - This Cincinnati stop is part of the “getting America back on track tour” as administration officials travel to a dozen states. Roundtable will focus on the “impact and value of public transit.” - American Rescue Plan allocated $110 billion for public transit and the American Jobs Plan would allocate $85 billion for it.<br> - VP will also discuss efforts to expand broadband access which she’s helping lead. Accessibility and affordability are two focuses for that. $100 billion in American Jobs Plan for broadband. “This is extremely important to the administration.” <br> - On approach to Northern Triangle: “We are really trying to figure out the best way to engage.” VP hasn’t engaged yet with leaders in Honduras and El Salvador not to say she won’t. Senior admin officials are working with government leaders and community leaders there. <br> - Today’s roundtable will show “how the federal government can partner and work with local leaders to help build more vibrant communities.”<br> - Kentucky/Ohio’s Brent Spence Bridge “could potentially be one of those projects” that receives funding from the American Jobs Plan if it gets passed (10 bridges in America will be chosen)<br> Taylor Popielarz Spectrum News Washington Reporter ▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊ @TaylorPopielarz Sent from my iPhone The contents of this e-mail message and any attachments are intended solely for the addressee(s) and may contain confidential and/or legally privileged information.

She also told this to elementary students in New Hampshire on her trip there at the start of this Help is Here tour </div> <div><br> </div> <div><b>Transcript from otter </b></div> <div><br> </div> <div>Thank you. Firstly so I'd like to say good morning to everyone to to the students and the teachers and the principal and and of course to the press and thank you for being here. I am a teacher and I've been teaching 36 years. So I feel right at home here in this school.<br> <div><br> </div> <div>And so actually I was on my phone this morning with with a lot of my students because we're going through final exams now. So they were doing their outlines for their final exam so I was texting with students this morning already. And so I just love being here and listening to you.<br> </div> <div><br> </div> <div>And this semester has been so hard. Hasn’t it? It’s been so hard. And I don't know what your plans are for your school but we’re hoping to go back at my school — I teach at a community college. And so we're hoping to be back on campus like in the fall. And I said to my students you know “How are you making out?” and they said “oh we're just hanging on. We're just hoping you know we're back on campus.” And that's exactly how I feel. And because a lot of my students like probably some of you have lost family members they've had to deal with not only a lot of loss in their lives but this has been so different learning over zoom and and trying to connect and feel that sense of community that I think teachers create in classrooms that is so important.<br> </div> <div><br> </div> <div>And if I could say anything and this is what I tell my own students. If you could — I'm a writing teacher which is going to be obvious pretty soon. [laugh] But If you could write a journal. And just look at this time don't forget it and think about what did you learn about yourselves. You know were you stronger than you thought? Were you maybe it was harder than you thought. Did you change in some way? Did you find that you were kinder or did you find that you you know maybe felt sad so many days? So write this. Write it down. Because when you have your own children and you tell them about the pandemic of 2020 and 2021 and they say to you “but Mom What was it like? what was it really like?” Because you can't really explain right? The masks and the washing our hands and the distancing they're not gonna understand it. But if you if you can pull out your journal. And remember how you felt I think it's gonna be so important and it's actually going to be history for your family about what this time means.<br> </div> <div><br> </div> <div>So I want to thank you all for being here. You know I feel right at home. I just feel right at home in a school and I try to visit schools and teachers and students wherever I go because I want to learn your journey I want to learn more about you and what you're doing and your hopes your aspirations and where you'll build from here. So so I guess I'll hand it over to... who am I handing it over to? <br> </div> <div><br> </div> <div>Teacher Leslie began speaking said she went to state college near Willow Grove Pennsylvania and FLOTUS said “oh willow grove!”</div> <div><br> </div> <div>Pool was ushered out at 10:01am and will not be listening to the discussion. </div> <div><br> </div> <div><br> </div> <div><br> </div> <div> <div>Sent from my iPhone</div> <div>Jada Yuan</div> <div>Political Features Writer <i>The Washington Post</i></div> <div>▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊</div> <div>C: ▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊</div> <div>Twitter: @jadabird</div> <div>IG: @alphajada</div> </div> </div> </div>

American families received that $1400 check and auto sales are up 50% Things are moving. These checks are providing a heck of a lot of immediate relief for families and in turn leading to support for our economic recovery. Today's news comes on top of the recent news that we created 900000 jobs in the month of March. First two months of my administration we've created more jobs than in the first two months of any administration in American history.”<br><br>He credited the lawmakers for getting the package fast.<br><br>“I want to thank the members who supported the American Rescue Plan. And we still have a long way to go. We're 8 million jobs down from what it was more than before the pandemic began. But America's coming back.”<br><br><div>He talked about the “Asian American... and Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islanders community. I think most people don't realize just how diverse it is how many different dialects and languages and the like are spoken which is part of what we have to deal with.... We need to stand the AAPI community as a whole of government response with what we have to get done.” Noted that he signed an order related to racial equity soon after taking office. “That’s still the plan. That's my objective. And Kamala and I are heartened by the Senate's overwhelming bipartisan effort yesterday” in approving the hate crimes bill. <br><br>“That's a big deal....

I think our resolve was tested. But our faith never wavered. For the Navajo people we are nothing if we are not resilient. And we're so honored to share that with you today Dr. Biden the resiliency of the Navajo people where we are where we were a year from today to now. And I think this this pandemic has touched each and every one of us in a very personal way. There's not one of us that has not had some sense of loss over the last year.<br> </div> <div> <br> </div> <div> <b>President Jonathan Nez</b></div> <div> <br> </div> <div> Did you know when when you say the word Joe Biden in Navajo that's compassion translated. And when we were doing the campaign we put that name to Joe Biden Joe Biden. And that's how a lot of our elders remembered that at the polls. Just thought we'd share that with you today. <br> </div> <div> <br> </div> <div> [Thank you for witnesssing] the magnification of our resilience right here on the grounds of our nation's capitol.<br> </div> <div> <br> </div> <div> We met President Biden and vice president Harris last October. At that time nominee Biden promised to listen to native people and understood the importance of the government to government relationship.<br> </div> <div> <br> </div> <div> The sacred document that is at the Navajo Nation museum today Manny showed the First Lady Dr. Biden. The treaty the copy that we have that establishes this nation to nation dialogue that we have with the federal government.</div> <div> <br> </div> <div> The Navajo people came out and delivered the state of Arizona on election day even in the midst of a terrible pandemic. And I was sharing with the first lady that some precincts even had 60 70 80% turnout at the at the polls this past election and we are very pleased that the Biden Harris administration is keeping their promise by having a seat at the table for the Navajo Nation and other tribes. As we welcome First Lady Biden to the Navajo Nation we have to remember that we are still in the midst of the covid 19 pandemic. But but we also want to take this opportunity to highlight the Navajo Nation success in pushing back on the virus and the success we are having with the vaccination. Each day we are vaccinating more of our people. <br> </div> <div> <br> </div> <div> Our Navajo people have done a wonderful job adhering to the public health orders put forth by our health care experts and our first responders. They deserve a big big round of applause and we see many of them here today. <br> </div> <div> <br> </div> <div> We as leaders of the Navajo Nation listened to our public health experts. And we relied on the data and the facts to help mitigate the pandemic. And sometimes we wish that other leaders throughout the country would do the same. With the Biden Harris administration we've received much needed support through the Indian Health Service. And we are proud to report that close to 95000 residents have been fully vaccinated. Give him a round of applause. That's two doses which represents well over half of the adult population here on the Navajo Nation as we continue to emerge from the pandemic we also remember all the lives lost to COVID-19. We've lost 1263. Danette lives to the virus since the start of the pandemic. It's heartbreaking to speak with families who have lost mothers fathers grandparents brothers and sisters. And we are very thankful that first lady Biden is making time to speak with local residents educators and health care workers. While she is here. I believe your visit will help to ensure and inspire our people even more The First Lady of the United States with us here on our ancestral home is historic and uplifting. As we visit with our Navajo people tomorrow I want you to see firsthand the strength the determination the hope and resilience in the hearts of our people despite all of the challenges and setbacks. The Navajo people remain strong and overcoming the pandemic together and look forward to working with the Biden Harris administration to Build back better in the years to come. Not only to assist our people and empower them to create a brighter future for generations to come.<br> </div> <div> <br> </div> <div> And we look forward to partnering with this administration in its plans to invest in infrastructure especially here where we need that investment for roads broadband water and electricity. As we move forward we look forward to our time together. And we want you to know that there is always an open invitation from the Navajo Nation to you President Biden and vice president Harris cadore.<br> </div> <div> <br> </div> <div> God bless you God bless United States of America. And God bless the great Navajo Nation.<br> </div> <div> <br> </div> <div> <b>Vice President Myron Lizer</b></div> <div> <br> </div> <div> This evening we gather in a significant and sacred place. look all around you.<br> </div> <div> Navajo nation's veterans memorial park where we honor and recognize our Navajo veterans and Navajo Code Talkers. throughout many decades our past tribal warriors have met in this very spot to discuss and plan strategies to improve the livelihood of the people of the great Navajo Nation.<br> </div> <div> <br> </div> <div> Today we envision a new beginning of inter governmental collaboration and understanding. Over the past years the milestones were accomplished through federal partnership. And today we need to build upon those steps for a better future for children. Our priorities reflect the voices of the people. The Navajo business owners we heard about them just a few minutes ago at the museum Our farmers or ranchers our students and parents and our elders. Our people have endured so much harsh conditions over the time and situations and it is time to relieve some of that burden and the setbacks that they have experienced. In addition we also need to support in the areas of economic development and dual taxation constraints preservation and conservation of Navajo land the need for financial literacy and economic opportunities. As leaders we envision a great and prosperous future for our children. Scripture says that a man is truly blessed when he leaves an inheritance for his children and his children's children. And as we work here and we go forward together we look for those opportunities. And most importantly they would continue to be a part of the American dream. President Nez said very eloquently build back better. But on Indian country I've coined it the great catch up we need to catch up with the times. Indian country has been left behind. And this is the opportunity that we have before us. With this administration we hope that you will help us leave no stone unturned in that great advancement.</div> <div> <br> </div> <div>  <div> <b><a href=""https://www.nativebusinessmag.com/biden-campaign-adds-clara-pratte-navajo-to-lead-engagement-with-tribes/"" title=""https://www.nativebusinessmag.com/biden-campaign-adds-clara-pratte-navajo-to-lead-engagement-with-tribes/"">Clara Pratte</a> Biden Admin Tribal Engagement Leader (host/emcee) </b></div> </div> <div> <br> </div> <div> And Dr. Biden I think has been probably you‘be probably visited Navajo Nation now at least three times.

And knowing the commitment that the Biden Harris administration has to Indian country is is profound and it's deeply deeply moving. As someone who's worked in this field for a long time I can tell you this is not the norm but it should be the norm. We should expect this and we should have that partnership at the other side of our federal table. So we're just just so delighted and honored.<br> </div> <div> <br> </div> <div> But the distances here are vast Dr. Biden and I'm grateful that you're here to see again firsthand the need for infrastructure and development and all of these important things that we need they all go hand in hand.

But I think this is one of those evenings that Dr. Jill Biden will never forget especially in this beautiful setting that we are here in our great capital of the great Navajo Nation. As you can see the beautiful Window Rock behind us the vast landscape that you drove through and the many times that you've been here Dr. Jill Biden thank you from the bottom of my heart and my family's heart and from the nation most importantly for your visit again. It must be a record for you to be here more than one time two times. And now it's three times. I don't think that there's ever been any dignitary of that magnitude that has come here as often as you have. That takes great honor to know that you have great interest in the Navajo people the Navajo culture and understanding what we need in order to build ourselves to build up as honorable Vice President lizer said into a new environment new growth and building ourselves up into this modern world as we know as connected to the United States of America. <br> </div> <div> <br> </div> <div> But what I can say is that the reason why I think that you really really keep coming back to the nation is because you want to learn more from our Navajo people. And you want to take that back to the White House.<br> </div> <div> <br> </div> <div> It is something that was really a whole heart setting to know that we have beautiful understanding leadership in our woman nation.<br> </div> <div> <br> </div> <div> One of the most monumental powers that the reason why the Navajo Nation is still here is because of the woman nation. And that is so you heard it today. You're a fierce warrior. And you'll take that back with you. And I think that's something that's you're going to be admirable to understand when you advocate for services and healthcare advocate for services in education advocate for services and for veterans needs. <br> </div> <div> <br> </div> <div> We have not only a leader in the White House but a friend but most importantly a protector of our woman nation.

Because the resources and opportunities are not there. And so they have to go elsewhere.​""</div> <div><br> </div> <div>""I don't need to tell this group of experts that this is an issue that has been a long standing issue it is complex.

body-048,<p> <br> <br> After leaving the WOW Hall vaccination clinic Emhoff headed to the Hult Center for the Performing Arts Center in downtown Eugene Oregon arriving at 2:12 p.m. Monday April 5 2021. He convened a roundtable discussion with DeFazio Eugene Mayor Lucy Vinis along with representatives from pro bono legal groups in Oregon and local individuals impacted by COVID-19. <br> <br> Emhoff used the roundtable to listen and take notes he promised to bring back to Harris hearing from Shandel DeLille a Lane County resident who was evicted twice in 2020 and recalled waiting 16 weeks for unemployment benefits after losing her job of 23 years only to be denied. <br> <br> The second gentleman thanked her for sharing her story and promoted Biden’s American Rescue Plan saying it would serve as a “stop-gap” for crisis situations across the country.<br> <br> “Unfortunately it’s a story you see playing out all over the country” Emhoff said. “Folks who never expected to be in that situation losing their home losing benefits even losing eating. There’s folks who never thought they’d be in a food line you see those pictures miles long.”<br> <br> Representatives from Oregon Legal Aid Services Sexual Assault Support Services and the Lane County Legal Aid office of Oregon Law Center all took turns discussing changes and challenges they have faced since the pandemic set in. <br> <br> The conversation ended with a discussion of homelessness in Lane County and about fears of the upcoming end to the CDC’s eviction moratorium at the end of June. BB Beltran executive director of Sexual Assault Support Services said she believes the number of people requesting her group’s services will only increase with the end of the moratorium. <br> <br> “For our survivors I would characterize their situations as precarious at best before the pandemic and now it’s very unstable” Beltran said. “I anticipate survivors reaching out about the moratorium probably more than we can handle.”<br> <br> Erika Hente managing attorney from Lane County Legal Aid added that while some unhoused people have money to move into a house the problem is that there’s a lack of housing.<br> <br> Emhoff responded to the concerns by saying he would take concerns like the eviction moratorium the lack of housing and bring them back to the White House. He closed by saying the Biden administration is working hard to address the many issues.<br> <br> “You’re seeing the immediate results there’s shots there’s checks there’s thought to the future” he said. “You’ve got an administration that’s all over this and we’re doing everything possible to address these issues.”<br> <br> <br> </p>

body-219,"<div> <div> <div> <p> The previous email should say “Sorry in advance” for the length. The motorcade was holding and is now rolling as of 3:59</p> <p> VP took two questions after speaking. One on Northern Triangle work and one on vaccine hesitancy. </p> <p> Full quotes below. </p> <br> <p> On Northern Triangle: So we are making progress but let's just be very clear that this is a complicated complex issue that actually has been an issue for a long time and the work that we are putting into it now is work that is going to require a long standing commitment beyond administrations. It is work that is not going to evidence its impact overnight because the issues are so intractable and we're looking at my focus which is a diplomatic focus on the Northern Triangle it is about bringing together as I did the members of the cabinet.</p> <br> <p> And the progress there is that Commerce is going to host a virtual trade mission. The Department of Agriculture under the leadership of Secretary Vilsack is increasing its focus on the work that needs to happen to support the agricultural efforts of that region that have been decimated because of extreme climate because of poverty but it's evidenced itself in a number of ways including stream food insecurity. </p> <br> <p> We’re bringing together USAID which is increasing its work around its program that is focused on disaster relief. So this is some of the work that's happening as you know I met last week with the Prime Minister of Japan in approached him about the work that Japan can do in growth to assist. We are also working through the UN with Ambassador Thomas Greenfield around bringing our allies to really renew a focus in that region. So it is something that is going to require diplomatic work it is something that is going to require a multilateral approach in addition to what we can do with our agencies. </p> <br> <p> This week I'm bringing together foundation leaders from across our country to really encourage them to do more in terms of the civil society piece of this which will be about both growing the work that they've already done historically but also engaging civil society in the region in the Northern Triangle. </p> <div><br> </div> On Vaccine Hesitancy: <p> We have to take seriously the vaccine hesitancy issue. And I will argue however that we need to do that and always couple that with what we need to do to make sure people have access and they know where to actually get the vaccine because I'm finding as many people want to take it as just need to figure out where they can get i. </p> <br> <p> And by the way today as you all know April 19 we now have opened it up for everyone everyone is eligible over the age of 16. In terms of the hesitancy issue it's real. So that is about continuing to do the work of reminding folks that it is safe that it is effective that it will save their lives reminding folks that it is not enough to get vaccinated we also want to make sure people continue to wear their masks social distance wash their hands.</p> <br> <p> But you know we also have to realize that part of the hesitancy I'm hearing more of this comes from the fact that some people think well this thing just got created too quickly. Like it just overnight it seems to have occurred well we have to correct the record and make people aware and Dr. Fauci has talked about this this vaccine is the product of a long period of extensive research over many many years. So this is the work we have to do which is to educate people about the effectiveness specifically as it relates to the J&amp;J vaccine. I know the CDC has information on their website for people who are concerned but the reality is that at least right now and I believe that all of the scientists and the public health experts are telling us it has affected a very very small fraction of those who have received it and the most important thing again is that everyone gets the vaccine when it's their turn. We remain committed to the fact that we will have enough vaccines in the United States by the first of May to vaccinate everyone. And so we want to encourage everyone to do their part and to get their vaccine.</p> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> </div> <div><br> </div> <div> <div>-- <div> <p> Eugene Daniels | White House Reporter &amp; Playbook co-Author | <b>POLITICO </b>▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊ | <a href=""http://twitter.com/EugeneDaniels2"">@EugeneDaniels2</a></p> <br> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div>"

There is no question that this violence must end and we are thinking of the families that lost their loved ones. The President will speak later about the case.” </p> <p> Turning to PM Suga she said: </p> <p> “It is now my great pleasure to welcome the Prime Minister of Japan and to thank him for this visit which is the first visit to the United States of a world leader since we came into office. The President and I are very excited about the conversations we will have with the prime minister today. As you know Mr Prime Minister you and I met just about a month ago during the Quad summit which was a meeting with the United States with our allies Japan with Australia and with India where we had extensive conversations about the collaborations and the friendship around some of the biggest challenges facing our world.” </p> <p> “It is also a personal point of privilege for me to spend this time with you. As you know I come from California where we have a very strong and vibrant Japanese community who has made great contributions not only to the state but to the country.” </p> <p> <i>{At this point a plane flew overhead so difficult to hear} </i></p> <p> She noted “our mutual commitment to the Indo Pacific” and “importance of peace and prosperity in that region of the world.”  </p> <p> Speaking through a translator PM Suga said: “I would like to first of all express my sincere gratitude for inviting me as the first foreign guest in Washington despite the covid 19 pandemic since the inauguration of the Biden administration. I’m also very delighted to have the opportunity to meet with you vice-president Harris face to face today and have wonderful conversations. I am very much looking forward to it.” </p> <p> “Japan highly praises and appreciates that the Biden- Harris administration puts high importance on cooperating with its allies and partners. There is no other time than today that the  Japan-US alliance needs to be strong. This is an alliance that is connected by universal values such as freedom democracy and the rule of law.” </p> <p> “Today I very much look forward to discussing you with Vice-President Harris as well as with President Biden later on regarding important challenges a wide range of challenges that both Japan and the United States face and reconfirm the bond of our alliance.” </p> <p> VP Harris replied: “Thank you very much I look forward to our conversation.” </p> <p> <p>They exited the balcony at 11.17 am and returned to the ceremonial office room for the bilat meeting.</p></p> <p> <p><b>Participants in the meeting: </b></p></p> <p> <b>US Side</b></p> <p> T.H.

body-049,<p> <br> Emhoff received applause from a room of roughly 50 people including volunteers officials and community members getting vaccines after Emhoff praised the visitors for getting their vaccines. He then went to an empty bar area in the basement where Oregon Gov. Kate Brown and White Bird Executive Director Chris Hecht discussed the importance of equity and addressing racial disparities when it comes to impacts of COVID-19.<br> <br> “We know our communities of color have been disproportionately impacted and we have to do everything we can to put justice and equity at the center of our work” Brown said. <br> <br> Brown also applauded the new presidential administration for its work so far on response to the pandemic “making sure policy is based both in science and data.”<br> <br> Emhoff thanked the volunteers and the nurse who let him observe as she administered the vaccine and he noted the importance of having local groups like White Bird working with the state to help administer vaccines.<br> <br> “I love to see these partnerships between the state and local officials and communities” he said. “It’s a nice way to get the word out and reach communities. You really see things that were bad have been made so much work during the pandemic.”<br> <br> He added that the lessons learned by communities during the pandemic are a blueprint for the future saying that he hopes new partnerships continue after the pandemic has ended. <br> <br> Emhoff commented on how he is devoted to fixing issues with equity as he tours communities and brings information back to Vice President Kamala Harris. <br> <br> “I come to it as a longtime lawyer driven by passion for justice fight bullies fight unfairness” he said. “This package between the American Rescue Plan and the new jobs plan are going to address that in a way that’s fair and will help all Americans.”<br> <br> There were also leaders of several local social services on hand to provide comments. <br> <br> Hecht said he is confident the new administration will work to fix long-lasting health disparities in the country. <br> <br> “The administration is focused on ameliorating disparities in health and health care that for far too long have been part and parcel for systemic racism” Hecht said.<br> <br> Representatives from other groups were on hand to discuss their response to the pandemic. Oregon Rep. Peter DeFazio who accompanied Emhoff and Brown on the tour took time to say that President Joe Biden’s $2.3 trillion infrastructure plan has a “heavy emphasis on rewriting wrongs from the past in terms of inequity.”<br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> </p>

Speaking of his eating habit he lost about 30 pounds by going on a morning soup curry diet almost 10 years ago.  Mr. Suga was the chief cabinet secretary under Prime Minister Shinzo Abe for almost 8 years from Dec 2012-Sep 2020 and became the longest-serving chief cabinet secretary in the country. The main jobs of the chief cabinet secretary are to serve as the chief spokesperson of the government usually holding press briefings twice a day and to coordinate policies among the ministries and agencies. Mr. Suga specifically focused on domestic issues during his tenure.  He held his regular press briefings more than 3200 times while serving the chief cabinet secretary.  He had a famous morning routine waking up at 5am doing 100 sit-ups and going for a 40 min walk.  When Mr. Suga visited Washington on May 2019 he enjoyed a morning walk around the White House. His favorite book is ""It Worked for Me: In Life and Leadership"" by Colin Powell and Tony Koltz which has become a bestseller in Japan after Mr. Suga mentioned that he drew inspiration and guidance from it during his time as chief cabinet secretary.  Mr. Suga became Japan' 99th Prime Minister on September 16th 2020 succeeding Mr. Shinzo Abe the longest-serving prime minister in the country. Prime Minister Suga continues his morning walk routine. <u><b>&lt;Official working visit to US during the COVID-19 pandemic&gt;</b></u> Prime Minister Suga received 2 shots of the Pfizer vaccine on March 16 and April 6 respectively in Tokyo. Neither his wife Mariko nor any cabinet members are on the trip with him.  According to Japanese sources the size of the delegation accompanying Prime Minister Suga is around 80 a little bit smaller than usual. All delegation members including journalists have received 2 shots of the COVID-19 vaccine ahead of the trip. <u><b>&lt;PM Suga's past engagements with President Biden&gt;</b></u> Prime Minister Suga had a congratulatory phone call with President-elect Biden on Nov 11 2020 (ET) Prime Minister Suga had a phone call with President Biden on Jan 27.  Both leaders participated in G7 Leaders' video conference on Feb 19.  They also participated in the first-ever Quad leaders summit via video conference along with Prime Minister Morrison of Australia and Prime Minister Modi of India on March 12.  <u><b>&lt;Has President Biden visited Japan?&gt;</b></u> He visited Japan in Jan 1979 as a Senator and then in Aug 2011 and Dec 2013 as the Vice President. <u><b>&lt;Some firsts achieved in and around this visit&gt;</b></u> Today President Biden hosts Prime Minister Suga at the White House for an official working visit. This is President Biden's first in-person meeting with a foreign leader and as the White House says it reflects the importance of the bilateral relationship and the friendship with the Japanese people.  This is Prime Minister Suga's first time meeting with President Biden and Vice President Harris.  Secretary of State Anthony Blinken and Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin also visited Japan last month. It was their first foreign trip and first in-person talks with foreign counterparts.  President Obama also hosted Japanese Prime Minister Taro Aso at the White House on Feb 24 2009 as his first meeting with a foreign leader.

When we last spoke by telephone a few weeks ago we discussed our shared commitment to expanding opportunities in Guatemala and throughout the region. And as you of course know the people of Guatemala have been suffering greatly because of the recent hurricanes the persistent drought and of course the damage from covid-19. And as we have discussed these are the acute factors that in many ways are causing people to live their homes despite the fact that they would probably prefer to stay. There are also long-standing issues that are often called the root causes of immigration. We are looking at the issue of poverty and the lack therefore of economic opportunities; the issue of extreme weather conditions and the lack of climate adaptation as well as corruption and the lack of good governance and violence against women indigenous people LBGTQ people and Afro-descendants.”</div> <div><br> </div> <div>“We want to work with you to address both the acute causes as well as the root causes in a way that will bring hope to the people of Guatemala that there will be an opportunity for them if they stay at home.”</div> <div>“Part of the spirit behind our work is of course that the Western hemisphere is our collective home and the people in it and our neighbors including the people of Guatemala are nearby and we have a responsibility therefore to engage.” </div> <div>“The United States plans to increase relief to the region strengthen our cooperation to manage migration in an effective secure and humane manner.

The White House passes along the following —<div><br></div><div><p><b>BACKGROUND MEMORANDUM</b></p> <p><b>TO:</b> Out-of-Town Travel Pool</p><p><b>FROM:</b> White House Press Office</p><p><b>DATE:</b> April 30 2021</p><p><b>RE:</b> Background for the President’s Visit to Pennsylvania</p> <p><b><u>The Need for the American Jobs Plan in Pennsylvania</u></b></p> <p>Pennsylvania’s infrastructure received a C- grade on its Infrastructure Report Card. Toplines on the need for the American Jobs Plan in Pennsylvania include:</p> <ul><li>There are 3353 bridges and over 7540 miles of highway in poor condition and each driver pays $620 per year in costs due to driving on roads in need of repair.</li><li>From 2010 to 2020 Pennsylvania has experienced 37 extreme weather events costing the state up to $10 billion in damages.</li><li>Over the next 20 years Pennsylvania’s drinking water infrastructure will require $16.8 billion in additional funding.</li><li>In part due to a lack of available and affordable housing 720000 renters in Pennsylvania are rent burdened meaning they spend more than 30% of their income on rent.</li><li>5% of Pennsylvanians live in areas where by one definition there is no broadband infrastructure that provides minimally acceptable speeds and 14% of Pennsylvania households do not have an internet subscription.</li><li>In Pennsylvania 57% of residents live in a childcare desert.</li><li>Manufacturers account for more than 11% of total output in Pennsylvania employing 565000 workers or 9.3% of the state’s workforce.</li><li>In Pennsylvania an average low-income family spends 8-10% of their income on home energy costs forcing tough choices between paying energy bills and buying food medicine or other essentials. </li><li>As of 2019 there were 93861 Pennsylvanians working in clean energy and the American Jobs Plan invests in creating more well-paying union jobs advancing clean energy production.</li><li>Pennsylvania is home to over 800000 veterans 7.3% of whom are women and 55% of whom are over the age of 65.</li></ul> <p><b><u>The Need for the American Families Plan in Pennsylvania</u></b></p> <p>The American Families Plan (AFP) is an investment in Pennsylvania’s children and families. Toplines on the need for the American Families Plan in Pennsylvania include:</p> <ul><li><b>HIGHER EDUCATION:</b> The average cost of a 2-year degree in Pennsylvania is almost $5700 per year and high costs are part of the reason just 70% of students in Pennsylvania are able to complete a postsecondary degree of any kind within 6 years of enrolling. The AFP will provide at least two years of free community college to all students including Dreamers. It will also increase the maximum Pell Grant awards by approximately $1400 to support the nearly 200000 students in Pennsylvania who rely on Pell for their education. In addition the AFP will provide support to Pennsylvania’s 24 Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) Tribal Colleges and Universities (TCUs) Hispanic-serving institutions (HSIs) and other minority-serving institutions (MSIs).</li><li><b>UNIVERSAL PRE-SCHOOL: </b>Across the U.S. high-minority and high-poverty high schools have seen 9.4% and 11.4% declines in college enrollment respectively. Just 48700 (or 17%) of the 286000 3- and 4-year-olds in Pennsylvania have access to publicly-funded pre-school. The AFP will provide access to free high-quality pre-school to all 3- and 4-year-olds in Pennsylvania.</li><li><b>INVESTING IN TEACHERS:</b> Pennsylvania has seen a 49% decline in new teacher supply. In Pennsylvania just 6% of teachers are teachers of color while students of color make up 35% of the student population. The AFP will invest $9 billion in our teachers.</li><li><b>CHILD CARE: </b>The average annual cost of a child care center for a toddler in Pennsylvania is $11400 meaning that a two-parent household would on average need to spend 11% of their income to afford care for one child every year. The AFP will enable low and middle-income families to pay no more than 7% of their income on high-quality child care generating lifetime benefits for over 289000 children in Pennsylvania and helping working families.</li><li><b>PAID LEAVE:</b> In Pennsylvania and across the nation more than 110 million workers lack access to paid family leave and nearly 84 million lack access to paid medical leave. The AFP will create a national comprehensive paid family and medical leave program.</li><li><b>CHILD NUTRITION: </b>16% of children in Pennsylvania live in food insecure households and 28% are obese. The AFP will ensure that the nutritional needs of Pennsylvania’s children are met by expanding access to free school meals to an additional 288000 students and providing 947000 students with resources to purchase food over the summer.</li><li><b>HEALTH CARE: </b>The AFP will make the health insurance premium reductions in the ARP permanent. In Pennsylvania that means 122000 uninsured people will gain coverage and 126000 will on average save hundreds of dollars per year on their premiums.</li></ul><ul><li><b>TAX CUTS FOR WORKING FAMILIES</b>: 13% of children under the age of 18 in Pennsylvania are considered poor. In addition nearly 24% of people in Pennsylvania have household incomes below basic family budget thresholds. The AFP will bolster financial security and spur economic growth in Pennsylvania by reducing taxes on the middle class and those striving to break into it.</li></ul> <p><b><u>The Impact of the American Rescue Plan in Pennsylvania</u></b></p> <p>In total Pennsylvania will receive the following American Rescue Plan (ARP) funding:</p><p>· $7.4 billion in state fiscal relief and $4.9 billion in local fiscal relief.</p><p>· More than $5.1 billion in relief for K-12 schools.</p><p>· Economic impact payments of up to $1400 per person (above the $600 per person provided in December) for more than 8.1 million adults and 2.8 million children (or 86% of all adults and 84% of all children in the state).</p><p>· Additional relief of up to $1600 per child through the Child Tax Credit to the families of 2368000 children lifting 140000 children out of poverty.</p><p>· Additional relief of up to nearly $1000 through the Earned Income Tax Credit.</p><p>· Credit to 700000 childless workers including many in frontline jobs.</p><p>· Marketplace health insurance premiums that are $1402 lower per month for a 60-year old couple earning $75000 per year.</p> <p><b><u>Federal Support for Pennsylvania Vaccinations</u></b></p> <p><b>Pharmacies: </b>As of April 28 the Biden-Harris Administration has made vaccine available in over 1600 pharmacies across the state with over 1100 receiving deliveries in the past week. Participating stores are primarily Rite Aid CVS Topco and Walmart locations but span multiple other pharmacy partners.</p> <p><b>Community Health Centers: </b>The Biden-Harris Administration has invited 46 health centers in Pennsylvania to receive direct vaccine allocations spanning 30 cities. The centers combined have sites at over 300 different care delivery locations across the state. As of April 28 37700 doses have been delivered to Community Health Centers in Pennsylvania through the federal vaccinations program.</p> <p><b>Federal Funding:</b> As of April 26 the Biden-Harris Administration has provided over $212 million to the state to support vaccination operations. There are 13 federally-supported community vaccination centers in the state including one FEMA Pilot site at the Pennsylvania Convention Center. There are over 375 federal personnel currently deployed to the state to support vaccination operations in addition to over 430 federally-funded National Guard members currently supporting the COVID-19 response.</p></div> </div> </div>-- <br><div><div>Morgan Chalfant<div>White House correspondent The Hill</div><div>▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊</div><div>▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊</div></div></div>

The transition was ""seemless"" thanks to its professionals he added. FLOTUS asked if he had gone to counseling alone. “I started going alone and then I went to marriage counseling with my wife” he responded.</p> <p> FLOTUS then greeted a few consultants who are working from home and joined virtually through a computer monitor. “Thank you team!” FLOTUS said. She asked if they will come back to the office and where they are located. “It will be a fase approach for people to come in” Ms. Slaton said as she explained that Military OneSource has two offices in Virginia and one in Washington state.</p> <p> Dr. Biden asked if she could approach some of the staff members working on site. She talked to three of them. She jokingly asked to one of them if a faux flower that she had on her desk was a real daffodil and they both laughed. The call center staff members said that now is a busy season because it is tax season and they have a tax program. They also noted that they have received several calls regarding wellness and family support. FLOTUS asked if they have used the programs themselves. The said no.

So many people have lost jobs and need that kind of help for the first time. So many are frontline workers showing up every day to keep food on our tables while their own cupboards are empty at home. </p> <p>And so so many are moms and dads. </p> <p>Since the start of the pandemic I’ve heard the frustration again and again: What do I do if I can’t find a new job? Where will we go if we can’t pay our rent?</p> <p>One educator told me she has two callings in life: being a counselor and being a mom. And right now she feels like she’s failing at both. </p> <p>This morning I had the chance to visit a Head Start center and see how these challenges are playing out here in Birmingham.</p> <p>Reduced hours. Unemployment. Parents who are at the breaking point trying to keep their jobs and take care of their kids. </p> <p>Families are struggling. </p> <p>So for a moment I want to speak to those parents from one mom to another. </p> <p>This is hard. I know that you would do anything for your child. You want to give them the world. Every parent does. You’re doing your best—working as hard as you can—but you still find yourself sitting at the kitchen table long after the kids are in bed surrounded by bills and trying to do impossible math: What gets cut when the only things left are necessities? </p> <p>But for those who feel like you are living day after day just holding your breath I want you to know this: Help is here.</p> <p>The American Rescue Plan is going to change your lifein so many ways and today I want to talk about a fewbig ones:</p> <p>First we’re going to create a life raft for families who are drowning right now. Already millions of Americans—including children—have received fourteen-hundred dollars apiece. And with changes to the Child Tax Credit even more help is coming. </p> <p>So what does that mean for families right here in Birmingham?</p> <p>In the past you used to receive a $2000 tax credit for your child on your tax return. This year if you have kids under 6-years-old that number is going to be $3600. And for older children it will be $3000. </p> <p>Before you would get that money next year when you file your taxes and get your return. But we know that families need help now. So under the American Rescue Plan payments are going to start going out this summer. </p> <p>And while in the past families in the lowest income bracket didn’t qualify for that money they now will. </p> <p>Because of this help the American Rescue Plan is going to cut child poverty in half. </p> <p>Families will be able to buy diapers or replace the shoes their children outgrew. It will mean catching up on past bills so the electricity stays on. </p> <p>But a life raft alone isn’t enough. We want to help families get back on dry ground.</p> <p>Parents want to work but they can’t if they’re busy taking care of children or supporting remote learning. That’s why millions of women have dropped out of the workforce. </p> <p>Right now we’re re-opening schools safely so kids can get back to classrooms and learning with their teachers and friends. And we’re going to make sure you have safe affordable child care options as well. For millions of families you’ll be able to get half of your child care expenses back through your tax return early next year—up to $8000.</p> <p>All parents want to work hard and build a good life for their children. With the support that the American Rescue Plan provides they’ll be able to do just that. They’ll be able to get back on dry land and breathe freely once again. </p> <p>As a teacher myself I’ve always appreciated Fred Rogers or Mr. Rogers to the generations of children who grew up watching his show. </p> <p>He once wrote: “When the gusty winds blow and shake our lives if we know that people care about us we may bend with the wind...but we won’t break.”</p> <p>Our nation faces some strong winds right now. Birmingham faces some strong winds. But what I want families to know is this: Your President cares about you. He’s a president for all Americans and he sees you. </p> <p>This administration is going to make sure that you have what you need to get through the storm. </p> <p>This pandemic will not break us. I<a name=""m_-2065348778914278467__GoBack""></a>n fact we are going to be stronger than ever. </p> <p>That’s what the American Rescue Plan is all about: help for families today so we can build back better tomorrow. </p></div><div><blockquote><div><div><div><div><br></div></div></div></div></blockquote></div></div></div>-- <br><div><div><table><tbody><tr><td><p><img alt=""A on ▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊"" height=""57"" src=""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/ZdGW9ao1vPzFTi62HUYc7iDeUiLR2mI1Y5a_zLukCEQL2LGDVziQA9815OGcIojiBeJZtP7HPc9g3WJ6H-ImsET2tIdaE0SsdiPriZA5MuC3nNZubmWDaaLB7TmVEuEQq6m1-HA2""></p></td><td><p>Sarah Mucha</p><p>Politics Reporter</p><p>▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊ | ▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊</p></td></tr></tbody></table><br></div></div>"

body-377,"<div> Dr. Jill Biden was escorted into the room -- First Choice Community Healthcare South Valley Medical Center computer printed paper signs everywhere saying the name -- by Dr. Will Kaufman and Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham. </div> <div> <br> </div> <div> Biden had changed into a purplish cloth mask with pink butterflies (some kind of pattern hard to tell). </div> <div> Lujan Grisham had changed into what looked like a white K-95 mask. </div> <div> <br> </div> <div> <div>Dr. Kaufman started out by thanking them for coming said it had been a hard year. Talked about the outreach the center is doing to fight health inequities and get the vaccine to many communities. ""People are tired but people are hopeful you know and to be able to be part of this the amount of work that we do is a little bit different to get patients here for a vaccination. We do a huge amount of outreach as a community health center calling patients bringing them in giving them resources to make sure they get here and our incredible teams work overtime and work weekends so that they can get here but but you know it's really it's really our passion. We're so excited you’re here.</div> <div><br> </div> <div>Gov. Lujan Grisham: ""Can I brag about you Dr. Kaufman? They are a lynchpin in our equity and it's one of the reasons that New Mexico's leading in diversity and equity investments making sure that all minority communities have investment leadership just like you're seeing right here."" <br> </div> <div><br> </div> <div>Dr. Kaufman went on to thank the governor for the support community health centers get from the state. </div> <div><br> </div> <div>Kaufman: ""Thank you governor. I think it's actually to me that's the core of hat community health centers are -- is really combating to eliminate health disparities. And so that's something that is what we need to do but we can't do that alone right? If we’re going to eliminate health disparities we have to have partners and the state has just been an unbelievable partner. We were in those discussions months before the vaccine got here to be able to say what do we need to be able to vaccinate our patients and the state has an incredible job of setting up the infrastructure to do two things: speed that can get people done fast but then US equity that we can do that We can do that extra level. And it's just been it's been a real joy for us to be able to have that chance.""</div> <div><br> </div> <div>Biden asked if it was all nurses doing the injections. Kaufman said it was a mixture of nurses nurse practitioners medical assistants. </div> <div><br> </div> <div>To the first woman Biden said ""So I've had this shot and it doesn't hurt. I promise. Normally I’m scared of them. I have to say it’s like so fast! Are you a little scared? Are you a little anxious?""<br> </div> <div><br> </div> <div>""Yeah. I’m scared. I’m nervous"" said the woman wearing a blue button down. </div> <div><br> </div> <div>Biden walked over. ""You’re scared? Do you want me to come stand with you? I'll stay with her."" The woman maybe said she can't look at the needle in her arm (hard to hear).</div> <div><br> </div> <div>""I can't look either. Look at me"" said Biden. ""It doesn't hurt. Really. It's mostly in your head."" </div> <div><br> </div> <div>""I know"" said the woman. </div> <div><br> </div> <div>""You all right? Look at me"" said Biden. </div> <div><br> </div> <div>""All done."" said the vaccinator. </div> <div><br> </div> <div>Biden applauded as did the rest of the room.

Thank you from the bottom of my heart.""<br> </div> <div><br> </div> <div>As Biden walked over to the second woman Viviana Galvez who works in patient registration the vaccinator (in a white and black horizontal striped shirt) said. ""She would like somewhere else to pray to."" </div> <div><br> </div> <div>""All right! Can I crash?"" said Biden jaunting over. Either she or the vaccinator told Viviana (in all black except for a black and white scarf). </div> <div><br> </div> <div>""So why did you decide to come? You felt a duty? Did you have any hesitation?"" Biden asked her. </div> <div><br> </div> <div>""I did. I was hesitant a little bit"" said Viviana. ""I mean I didn't know what was going in my body. And I'm doing them for the community my family...""</div> <div><br> </div> <div>""Right that's what we want for you"" said Dr. Biden </div> <div><br> </div> <div>Viviana continued ""... and for myself. Let's get those numbers going down guy. No more lives to lose.""<br> </div> <div><br> </div> <div>""Okay are you ready? One two three little poke! Good job"" said the vaccinator. </div> <div> <br> </div> <div>""That was it? That was quick!"" said Viviana. Biden cheered: ""Yay! You did it!"" </div> <div><br> </div> <div>She walked over to see if she could help the last person a man who was getting vaccinated but he'd already gotten his shot. </div> <div><br> </div> <div>""Thank you very much for coming. We appreciate it"" she told him. <br> </div> <div><br> </div> <div>""Tell all your friends"" said Lujan Grisham. </div> <div><br> </div> <div>""Yeah bring your friends back and tell them how easy it was"" said Biden </div> <div><br> </div> <div>Viviana Galvez told the cameras (please check this) ""Muy facíl todos vengan a First Choice para sus vaccinos."" (Very easy everyone come to First Choice for their vaccines.) <br> </div> <div><br> </div> <div>""Yes!"" said Biden at least seeming like she understood the Spanish. </div> <div><br> </div> <div>They then walked to the front of the room where there was a basket of buttons and a roll of stickers to give out. I believe they were yellow one of the NM state colors. </div> <div><br> </div> <div>""I'll do the buttons"" said Biden. ""I'll do the stickers"" said Lujan Grisham. </div> <div><br> </div> <div>Some people were not done with their waiting / observation period after getting their shots and couldn't go to the front of the room so Lujan Grisham asked if she could walk around and pass out stickers. </div> <div><br> </div> <div>She said things like: </div> <div><br> </div> <div>""Thank you from the bottom of my heart for getting vaccinated you are courageous and incredible and a good public high steward.""</div> <div><br> </div> <div>""Thank you so much for your leadership. I appreciate you."" </div> <div><br> </div> <div>Dr. Kaufman ended by praising Lujan Grisham's leadership and belief in science and telling Biden that her visit and the work of the administration gave him hope. </div> <div>""I just want to say one quick thing to the both of you. We have as healthcare providers and as New Mexicans. We want to thank you Governor for leading us through this time. And my daughter told me this morning that she just feels so proud to have somebody so strong and so smart and so dedicated to science as she is to be leading us and we are so grateful and that has kept us hopeful through this time. And Dr. Biden for you to be here is such a sign of hope for us now. And all that the administration is doing for all of us for community health centers so that we can continue to fight against health disparities to eliminate health disparities. We're so hopeful into the future because of all that you and the administration are doing.

body-348,"<div> <p><b>Full speech from Jill Biden at Navajo Nation (corrected Trint transcript let me know if you need audio) </b></p> <p><b>That's it for tonight! See you bright and early tomorrow. </b></p> <p>Oh please sit down. </p> <p>You know I've had a great visit here so far and I just met with a group of women who I now call my sister warriors. And so it was so nice to meet with all of you. And I really appreciate your spending time with me. And I wanted to thank Madam chief justice for your kind words. They were just beautiful. Thank you so much. And thank you Mr. Speaker. And all the legislators who are here today. And I'll thank the president and the vice president in a second. By you know surrounded by the four sacred mountains. I'm privileged and I'm proud to be here with the Diné people in Window Rock Your Nation's Capital. And I'm especially honored to join you on a day that we celebrate and we recommit to protecting Mother Earth. So thank you President Nez and first lady Phenelia for once again welcoming me now as the first lady of the United States to address the Navajo Nation. And I want to thank the vice president Myron and the second lady and to all of the Navajo Nation leaders with us today. So you honor me with your presence and to all of those who are here with us in person and to everyone who's listening to us by radio. [applause']. </p> <p>Recently I saw a beautiful Navajo wedding basket the white star in the middle the Red River the Black Mountains. And as I looked at it the break in the circle caught my eye and I wondered what that space meant when I looked it up. I learned that there are different interpretations but it's often seen to represent the Diné emergence into this world and the path of life. And I read that this open circle represented a broader concept that the world was created in perfect beauty and harmony. Hozhó. While perfection is static life is not. As the world changes around us and chaos disrupts we must have a path forward a way to rediscover and recreate the harmony we need. </p> <p>Adaptability persistence resilience strength over the years. These are the qualities I have seen most in your nation. In 2013 I joined Navajo Technical College to give a commencement. I met students who were working two jobs and trying to keep up in school when they had no electricity in their homes. I heard about young people who had dropped out because of the enormous challenges they faced only to re-enroll and become honor students. </p> <p>Persistence. In twenty nineteen when I joined Lady Phenelia and President Nez in Tuba City to open a cancer treatment center so many people were relieved that they would no longer have to travel hours literally hours to get lifesaving treatment. That center is the very first of its kind in Indian country but it will not be the last. [applause]. </p> <p>Strength. And just last year your first lady joined me for a native talking circle. We heard from tribal leaders about the issues that Indian Country faces. And I saw the excitement people had to get out the vote. At that gathering I promised that as President Joe in a Biden-Harris administration would stand with Indian Country and all of you. [applause] And today as your first lady in our first 100 days I am here to let you know that we are keeping that promise. We stand with you the Navajo Nation. [applause] As you govern our administration will work in partnership with you honoring the solemn trust responsibility to tribal nations. As President Joe has already delivered the largest single investment ever made in Indian country. </p> <p>This pandemic has been so painful and last May the Navajo Nation had the highest per capita infection rate in the United States. So many elders and cultural leaders and family members young and old have been taken by this virus. We feel their loss deeply every day.  </p> <p>Adaptability. Working with Indian Health Service President Nez the Navajo Nation Council and this entire community adapted committing to safety members that brought down the number of cases. And as of today the Navajo Nation has vaccinated more than half of those living on tribal lands [applause] with few resources reaching people in some of the most remote areas. The Navajo Nation is a leading example of the covid response in the United States. You're doing the work. Now the federal government must work for you. We relaunched the White House Council on Native American Affairs to guide our work across the administration. President Biden passed the American rescue plan investing billions to help you continue to combat covid and stabilize safety net programs. And my husband has proposed the American jobs plan which includes funding for badly needed infrastructure from running water to broadband new roads to electricity. This plan will provide good paying jobs including right here in the Navajo Nation.  </p> <p>And of course under the leadership of Secretary Haaland the Biden Harris Department of the Interior will be the stewards of our public lands with a renewed commitment to our tribal trust and treaty responsibilities. And today I've been joined by Bryan Newland who is our new -- he's standing back there -- as our new assistant secretary for Indian affairs. And this at nearly 100 days. And we're just getting started.</p> <p>Tribes will always have a voice in our administration and we're committed to honoring tribal sovereignty and strengthening our nation-to-nation relationship. On last year's Earth Day President Nez wrote ""Protecting Mother Earth starts with us."" And he's right. It's on all of us together to find the path back to hozhó. Harmony and beauty the world as it should be. Despite the challenges that you faced the Navajo Nation lives that truth again and again. </p> <p>You live the beauty way prayer. Which is:.  </p> <p>With beauty before me I walk. With beauty behind me I walk. With beauty above and about me I walk. It is finished in beauty; it is finished in beauty. </p> <p>On this path of life Joe and I will walk with you. We stand with the Navajo Nation today tomorrow and always.

body-518,<div> <div>Here’s a rough transcript per Otter of the five questions VP Harris took at the end of the roundtable event. As of 2:17pm pool is waiting in the press vans outside the Innovation Hub in Cincinnati. I’ll tweet out a few more pictures from the roundtable @TaylorPopielarz.</div> <div><br> </div> <div><br> </div> <div>Q: Madam Vice President could you speak to the crisis in India right now concerning COVID and what lessons you take from that?</div> <div> <br> </div> <div>VP: There is no question that it is a great tragedy in terms of the loss of life and as I have said before and I will say again we as a country have made a commitment to the people of India to support them. And we've made already a commitment in terms of a dollar amount that will go to PPE and a number of other things. But it is tragic. And you know my prayers go to the people on the suffering the blatant suffering that is happening.</div> <div> <br> </div> <div>Q: Does it give you any concern about how their experience could affect what's happening in the United States concerning COVID?</div> <div> <br> </div> <div>VP: Well I mean we are all part of a world community. And to the extent that any of us as human beings who have any level of compassion see suffering anywhere around the world it impacts all of us.</div> <div> <br> </div> <div>[Sen. Brown jumps in to build off that answer]</div> <div> <br> </div> <div>Aide: We’ll take one more question.</div> <div> <br> </div> <div>Q: Madam Vice President regarding infrastructure as you're continuing to push the American jobs plan what's your message and how are you going to approach Republican voters or voters in general who may be skeptical of this expanded definition of infrastructure? Because the conversation here right now was focused on infrastructure and you know hitting all corners of life but a lot of voters feel that it should just be roads and bridges.</div> <div> <br> </div> <div>VP: I am willing to bet you that when the people of Cincinnati get on those buses being driven by Troy Miller's members they do not ask are you a republican or democrat? I'm willing to bet you. When we are talking about those moms who need to walk on the sidewalk to get to the bus pushing a stroller walking a toddler they are not identifying their problem through the lens of who they voted for in the last election. When we are looking at the capacity to grow the economic vitality of communities including small businesses and increase the productivity of the workforce much less expand the workforce what we know is that the reality is that people regardless of who they vote for him with which party they registered with that's what they want. And that's what they want to see their government focus on.</div> <div> <br> </div> <div>Q: Can you speak to your priority for broadband Madam Vice President?</div> <div> <br> </div> <div>VP: [inaudible] priority — is something I've worked on for quite some time. It is it is an extension of this conversation frankly. I gave a speech yesterday talking about this. I was in you will appreciate this Chairman I was with our former colleagues Maggie Hasson and Jeanne Shaheen in New Hampshire visiting the New Hampshire Electric Coop. and met with some workers there who were part of a legacy of folks at that coop will help build electrification for rural New Hampshire. And it was on the basis of the work literally the physical basis of the work they did as a result of the 1936 Rural Electrification Act which was about saying let's get electricity everybody to say now let's get broadband to everybody. It’s the same point. kids can't do their homework. Without the access to the internet. You know some of us had Encyclopedia Britannica well let me tell you that is a day gone by. Our seniors we now know the capacity of access and affordable access to broadband to bring health care through telemedicine. Again our small businesses it has become very clear for a small business to actually survive much less thrive they need access to high speed internet to be able to move their product to advertise their product and to engage with their customers. So it crosses all levels all communities. And you know in the past with electrification I think it was one of the great examples of the role of responsibility of the federal government to meet the needs of the people where they are and to invest in America in a way that we will be competitive going forward. Broadband is the next example of that.</div> <div> <br> </div> <div>Q: And do you see any bridges in this area qualifying for that top 10 list? </div> <div> <br> </div> <div>VP: Well I can tell you that I know about the Brent Spence Bridge and it is a very important bridge in America. And I'm sure that there will be a lot of conversation about its qualifications for some support out of the American Jobs Plan.</div> <div> <br> </div> <div>[end]</div> </div> <div><br> </div> <br> <div> <div> <div> <b>Taylor Popielarz</b></div> <div> Spectrum News Washington Reporter</div> <div> C: ▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊</div> <div> @TaylorPopielarz</div> <div> <br> </div> <br> </div> <br> </div> <br> The contents of this e-mail message and <br>any attachments are intended solely for the <br>addressee(s) and may contain confidential <br>and/or legally privileged information.

body-382,"<p> Following remarks by CHCB Chief Medical Officer Dr. Heather Stein CHCB Nurse Manager Alicia Schwarz and Grand Isle Volunteer Fire Department Firefighter William “Bill” Baron Mr. Emhoff asked them all how they were addressing vaccine skepticism and the digital divide among rural Vermonters.<br> <br> “In most of our visits our clinicians our nurses are talking to our patients about why we care about them and why because we care them and care about their neighbors and family it’s so important for them to get vaccinated” said Stein. The health clinic has also partnered with a local housing trust to create a mobile clinic to test and vaccinate houseless Vermonters staying at transitional housing sites and regional lodging areas. <br> <br> “When folks come to these clinics they see familiar faces” said Baron. The volunteer fire department has opened up its doors as a “safe haven” for local health clinics Baron added ensuring older residents have access to the vaccine within their area. <br> <br> To ensure that information reached all parts of their community Baron added officials have posted information in local newspapers and through the community social network app Front Porch Forum.<br> <br> By 12 p.m. the roundtable wrapped up with closing remarks from the second gentleman who praised health care workers at the Community Health Centers of Burlington for their continual work and resilience through the pandemic. <br> <br> “This is such an unprecedent crisis that it’s really all hands on deck” Emhoff said. The second gentleman also spoke about his role in <br> <br> “It’s just a great opportunity to have this role because I get to travel around the country and I get to really see what’s going on and I heard some issues and I heard some stuff from the governor and the other great leaders and take it back and so we try to make things better.”<br> <br> Emhoff ended his stop by taking photographs with clinic staff and state officials. <br> <br> At 12:35 p.m. Mr. Emhoff arrived to Old North End Community Center about a five minute drive from the Community Health Centers of Burlington.<br> <br> Upon entering the building and walking into the main gymnasium the second gentleman was greeted with a performance by local musician and social worker Irene “KeruBo” Webster. Webster works as a case manager with the Association of Africans Living in Vermont (AALV) assisting Swahili-speaking New American residents in the Burlington area.<br> <br> AALV is one of the organizations in Vermont that has spearheaded efforts to translate and disseminate public health information about the COVID-19 pandemic and vaccine to New American residents.<br> <br> Webster sang a song she wrote titled “Chanjo” – the Swahili word for “vaccine”. The song is written in the Swahili language and its content highlights coronavirus safety measures and encourages local residents to get vaccinated.<br> <br> Following the performance Emhoff asked Webster about the significance behind the song. Webster explained that many of the clients and community members she knows and works with had concerns and fears about the COVID-19 vaccine stemming primarily from misinformation circulated on social media and the legacy of colonization as a source of distrust against vaccinations for New Americans.<br> <br> “The history of what has been happening in Africa the colonization the big pharmacies doing trials and experiments without the consent of families...just that mistrust was causing these families to not engage in this effort” Webster said. <br> <br> Webster added that since writing the song and releasing an accompanying music video she has seen increased turnout among New American residents at vaccine clinics. <br> <br> “The work you do in your community is so important” Emhoff said. “If they have folks that they trust that they know they’re more likely to receive (the vaccine).”<br> <br> That concluded Mr. Emhoff’s visit.<br> <br> <br> <b>From: </b>""Bhattacharya Megha EOP/OVP"" &lt;▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊&gt; <b>Date: </b>Wednesday April 21 2021 at 11:22 AM <b>To: </b>""Bakuli Ethan"" &lt;▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊&gt; <b>Subject: </b>RE: Press pool reports for 4/21/21 Burlington visit<br> <br> Perfect thank you!<br> <br> <b>From:</b> Bakuli Ethan &lt;▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊&gt; <b>Sent:</b> Wednesday April 21 2021 11:18 AM <b>To:</b> Bhattacharya Megha EOP/OVP &lt;▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊&gt; <b>Subject:</b> [EXTERNAL] Press pool reports for 4/21/21 Burlington visit<br> <br> Second Gentleman Doug Emhoff arrived at Community Health Centers of Burlington at 11:08 am.<br> <br> He arrived in time to see Bishnu Subedi a recent New American resident living in the Burlington area receive her first dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine. <br> <br> Subedi spoke briefly with Mr. Emhoff about the importance of getting vaccinated and why she hoped others would follow in her steps.<br> <br> “These shots they work they’re painless” Emhoff said. <br> <br> “ I want to be a part of ending this pandemic and that’s why I’m getting vaccinated” said Subedi 28 who arrived to the United States from Nepal in March of this year. <br> <br> As Subedi received her vaccination Emhoff encouraged her that it would be alright.<br> <br> “I did it twice it’s all good” he said. <br> <br> <br> Get <a href=""#""> Outlook for iOS</a><br> <br> </p>"

body-529,"<p> ﻿VP Harris’ motorcade arrived at the 1819 Innovation Hub in Cincinnati at 12:31pm after an uneventful 28-minute drive from Kentucky along an empty Interstate 275. A few onlookers watched the motorcade roll by and shot pictures/video on their phones while standing outside their workplace or in parking lots. Along a stretch of Interstate 471 several people got out of their cars and took photos while standing in the median.  As we arrived at the hub several dozen observers were gathered outside including some Trump supporters complete with flags and signs.

They do the vaccines in 30 minute increments. </div> </div> <div><br> </div> <div>We are in a carpeted room. Three vaccination spots are set up at the front of the room separated by mint green fabric dividers in metal frames. Each has an administrator standing in face mask and goggles and a patient sitting in a chair. Other people who had already received the vaccine were sitting socially distanced at tables facing the other direction. I think this is a break room. There’s a demo kitchen (clear signs posted that it is not for residential use) with a fridge and stove to the left of the vaccination pods.</div> <div><br> </div> <div>FLOTUS and Gov.

Everyone applauded. </div> <div><br> </div> </div> <div><br> </div> <div>To the next woman FLOTUS came over.

You felt a duty? Did you have any hesitation?""</div> <div> <div> <br> </div> <div> Viviana: ""I did was hesitant a little bit. I mean I didn't know what was going in my body.

Mayorkas to address what is going on at the border and he has been working very hard and is showing some progress because of his hard work. I have been asked to lead the issue of addressing the root causes similar to what the then-vice president did many years ago but I will tell you that these are not issues that are going to be addressed overnight in terms of the root causes issue. A large part of our focus is diplomatic in terms of what we can do in a way that is about working with these countries. For example I have talked with the president of Mexico the president of Guatemala. — I'm probably saying too much — but we have plans in the work to go to Guatemala as soon as possible given all the restrictions in terms of COVID and things of that nature. But these are areas of focus for a very important and good reason. We must address the symptoms and that is what is happening with the team of folks working on the border led by Ali Mayorkas but we also have to deal with the root causes otherwise we are just in a perpetual system. Our goal is to deal with the root causes and I'm happy looking forward to be travelling for what will be hopefully my first trip to the Northern Triangle stopping first in Mexico and then Guatemala sometime soon."" </div><div><br></div><div>Q: ""Madame Vice President how do you evaluate 'success?' This has been a problem for many years""</div><div><br></div><div>A: ""There are many metrics and I'm happy to follow up with you after I talk to the experts also but I agree with you. We have to agree on how we will assess our impact. But let me be clear people who've been working on this for decades will tell you it will not be obvious overnight. The work we are going to have to do will require a commitment that is continuous that we institutionalize with our partners and that's the work that I'm prepared to do which is to begin that process of meaningful work knowing that we are going to have to have a long-term strategy and it will take some time to see the benefits of that work.

body-314,"<div> <div> <div> <div>** Note about the school we visited like all other schools on Navajo Nation it is federally funded through the Bureau of Indian Education appeals for improvements have to be to the federal government. There are no property taxes on Navajo Nation. Thanks to Noel Lyn Smith of The Daily Times in Farmington NM for background. </div> </div> <div><br> </div> <div>Motorcade left the school at 11:34am which means Dr. Biden met with students and teachers for an hour and half. We are en route to the vaccination center. As we entered Fort Defiance about 20 people stood on the side of the road some in neon reflective vests filming and waving. A sign outside a school we passed says “Home of the Scouts.” </div> <div><br> </div> <div>In Fort Defiance more workers stood outside in aprons. Some wore hospital scrubs. Clusters of 5-10 stood near pickup trucks. Some had dogs. Some were kids. An couple of elders stood leaning on canes and waving. A lone brown horse with a black mane was eating in a field and paid us no attention. </div> <div><br> </div> <div>Arrival at noon. Tsehootsooi Medical Center a tribal healthcare facility with a COVID-19 vaccination clinic on the Navajo Nation. Also federally funded. </div> <div><br> </div> <div>Dr. Biden said hello to fire fighters and emerged from cafe carrying two white boxes with cellophane windows on top. Your pooler asked what she was carrying. </div> <div><br> </div> <div>“Cookies for the workers” </div> <div><br> </div> <div>She was accompanied by President Nez and First Lady Phenelia Nez. There are two people in uniform public health officers. </div> <div><br> </div> <div>She was shown around by Dr. Sandi Adkins Chief Executive Officer who is the one in the white hat in photos. And Mrs. Margaret Lynch Executive Vice President for Corporate Operations. </div> <div><br> </div> <div>It is hard to hear. We are outside the tent in the parking lot of the medical center. </div> <div><br> </div> <div>DR. ADKINS </div> <div>When we got our first doses of the vaccine it was January. We had icicles on our eyelashes. (I believe she said they were administering to people in their cars.)</div> <div><br> </div> <div>BIDEN </div> <div>Oh my goodness </div> <div><br> </div> <div>ADKINS</div> <div>Now we are doing them in the tent. </div> <div><br> </div> <div>Adkins then brought her the front of the tent to meet four members of the hospital staff names below. The one in uniform is Commander Leah Earl-Begay. Introducing chief administrative officer Ms. Tina James-Tafoya Lynch said she was former Miss Navajo. “I always hate when she tells people that” said James-Tafoya who was dressed in a traditional teal outfit. </div> <div><br> </div> <div>On the other side of the tent Biden was introduced to 8-10 frontline workers mostly RNs in scrubs but also administrators. “These are the people who were directing traffic and helping people park” said Adkins.</div> <div><br> </div> <div>President Nez and First Lady Phenelia walked around elbow bumping workers. </div> <div><br> </div> <div>President Nez spoke: </div> <div><br> </div> <div>“These are the warriors on the front line of the pandemic” (applause) </div> <div>He also said “Social media brought a lot of people in.”</div> <div><br> </div> <div>Adkins said “we’d put out something saying ‘come on down they have 500 doses left’ and people came. That’s how we got to the rate of vaccination that we are.”</div> <div><br> </div> <div>FLOTUS asked “Were you able to get out to people on rural areas?” Adkins said yes. They had mobile vaccinations. </div> <div><br> </div> <div>It was very windy. Dr. Biden seemed to have learned a lesson from yesterday and was wearing a black scarf. Up close you could see her dress had a tiered skirt. </div> <div><br> </div> <div>President Nez introduced <a href=""https://www.ihs.gov/sites/aboutihs/themes/responsive2017/display_objects/documents/bios/RoselynTso_NavajoArea.pdf"">Roselyn Tso</a> Navajo area director for Indian Health Servicd (please check title). She’s in a pink cardigan in photos. He said he’d told President Biden that he should nominate her to the Bureau of Indian Affairs. </div> <div><br> </div> <div>Dr. Biden laughed. “I happen to know that. I happen to know that! I’ve been briefed on this.”</div> <div><br> </div> <div>Nez: We went 10 straight days with no deaths low numbers. </div> <div><br> </div> <div>Roselyn: During the pandemic we brought in 1000 volunteers. Every day it is a very coordinated approach that requires lots of leadership. </div> <div><br> </div> <div>FLOTUS: You did a great job. You did a great job.</div> <div><br> </div> <div>Adkins: We’ve required a mask mandate. We are very thankful for all of the citizens here. </div> <div><br> </div> <div>FLOTUS: Working together right? Working together. </div> <div><br> </div> <div>She turned to the workers: “Thank you to all the front line workers.”</div> <div><br> </div> <div>Adkins: President Nez put some mandates in place early on that were not popular. I’m sure he got a lot of guff for them. But people knew we had to do that to protect each other. </div> <div><br> </div> <div>Nez: Tell your husband Joe that we appreciate the force of his action that within days of the Inauguration he was signing the emergency declaration for Navajo Nation. </div> <div><br> </div> <div>We appreciate the focus and attention you bring to our homeland. </div> <div><br> </div> <div> <div>Daniel Tso chair of health educaion and </div> <div>CEO of Indian Health Service spoke. He’s an elder with gray hair pulled back and was emotional. </div> <br> </div> <div>Daniel Tso: We are determined (emphasized) DETERMINED to provide the best healthcare we can to the Navajo people. It’s the frontline workers that don’t get the recognition the reward that other folks do and that’s what we put in our hearts and daily prayers. <br> </div> <div><br> </div> <div>Tso continued: I think the main the we have to do going forward is focus on mental health. People who’ve experienced Covid or who have lost people from Covid feel that. </div> <div><br> </div> <div>The Navajo way is not to forge forward alone. We go along as a community as a group. We have to keep doing that. We appreciate President Joe Biden. Last night you heard about the women nation. He is the perfect example of women nation by naming a woman Vice President. </div> <div><br> </div> <div>FLOTUS: Thank you for recognizing my husband’s commitment to healthcare and mental healthcare not just for Navajo Nation but for all Americans. </div> <div><br> </div> <div>Adkins emphasizes how much they relied on federal funding and how grateful they were for the infusion from the Biden adminstration.</div> <div><br> </div> <div>Adkins: There was a point halfway through last year where we didn’t know if we could keep the lights. </div> <div><br> </div> <div>But because of the CARES act and newer funding during the Biden admin “we never had to lay anyone off.”</div> <div><br> </div> <div>Before leaving Dr. Biden was presented with another beautiful blanket this one turquoise and black. She will have quite a nice collection! </div> <div><br> </div> <div>A sandstorm was kicking up just as we left around 12:33. A couple of clinic workers were laughing. “Two hours!” Which was how long they’d been waiting. “But at least we got to be outside” said one. </div> <div><br> </div> <div>En route back to Albuquerque.</div> <div><br> </div> <div><b>Background from FLOTUS office (you have this but for easy reference)</b></div> <div><br> </div> <div> <blockquote> <div> <div> <p> <u>MEDICAL CENTER</u></p> <p> The First Lady will visit Tsehootsooi Medical Center a tribal healthcare facility with a COVID-19 vaccination clinic on the Navajo Nation.

The pool overnighted here at <a href=""https://www.hauntedrooms.com/new-mexico/albuquerque/haunted-places/haunted-hotels/hotel-parq-central"" title=""https://www.hauntedrooms.com/new-mexico/albuquerque/haunted-places/haunted-hotels/hotel-parq-central"">Hotel Parq Central</a> and Dr. Biden spent this morning virtually teaching. Yesterday's 4/21 visit was to a vaccination center First Choice Community Healthcare in Albuquerque's majority-Hispanic South Valley district. </div> <div> <br> </div> <div> The pool has been tested for covid-19 in preparation for the First Lady's two-day visit to Navajo Nation. This entire three-day trip to New Mexico and Arizona is her longest solo trip as first lady. </div> <div> <br> </div> <div> She'll be going by car from Albuquerque to Window Rock Arizona the tribal capital -- about a 2-hour 45-minute drive northwest of Albuquerque and just west of the New Mexico border. Pool is spending the night in Gallup NM a thirty-minute drive back over the border. </div> <div> <br> </div> <div> The visit is meant to ""highlight the Administration's commitment to standing with the Navajo Nation and all of Indian Country"" according to her office. </div> <div> <br> </div> <div> Today there will be a welcoming ceremony at 5pm with President Jonathan Nez and other tribal leaders. She and First Lady Phefelia Nez will meet with Navajo women then Dr. Biden will give a live radio address to Navajo Nation in front of the red sandstone arch after which the tribal capital is named. It's also the site of a veteran's memorial the tribe established. According to the timing she may be giving the speech as the sun sets behind her which should make for a dramatic setting. </div> <div> <br> </div> <div> Tomorrow morning (4/23) she will attend a listening session with students from across Navajo Nation at a boarding school then will visit a vaccination site. After having the country's highest per-capita coronavirus rates nearly half of the Navajo Nation population is vaccinated far higher than the national average. </div> <div> <br> </div> <div> This is Dr. Biden's third trip to Navajo Nation but her first as first lady.

In fact it doesn't surprise me at all that you managed to make friends when your family moved to Germany despite not speaking any German. And then you became a mentor so that you could help others feel less alone. It's that resilience and heart that makes military kids like you so special. So thank you Ryzun for joining us today. </p> <p> You know I'll never forget the emotions that ran through me as I stood in front of the bow of the 2000-ton USS Gabrielle Giffords to christen her just praying the bottle I held in my hands would break when it was time. I was nervous and excited and most of all deeply proud to become an honorary member of the crew's family -- or as they say ""a shipmate for life.""</p> <p> Surrounded by the sounds and shouts and cheers I thought of the brave soldiers who would make up her crew and the families who stood by them. I felt a touch of longing in that celebration knowing that when the time came to bring this ship to life spouses and children parents and siblings would stay behind but a piece of their hearts would sail away. </p> <p> There's no ribbon cuttings or showers of champagne to christen their journey but it is that: a journey through the months apart happy homecomings and more deployments that transition to life after the military. </p> <p> In that moment the Giffords seemed to represent our entire armed forces. Anyone could look at its bridge its bow its towering mast and know this ship will be steady in the harshest winds strong enough to cut through the most<a> violent seas able to withstand any storm. Any yet so much of its power is unseen beneath the waves: the engines the anchors the rudder that gives it direction and purpose. </a></p> <p> The families of our service members and veterans; the caregivers who lift up our wounded ill and injured; the survivors who grieve those we’ve lost: You may not wear a uniform but you serve and you sacrifice for us all. </p> <p> Military families are as critical to our national defense as a rudder is to a ship and we must always act upon that truth. </p> <p> Today we write the next chapter of a White House initiative that First Lady Michelle Obama and I started 10 years ago: Joining Forces. </p> <p> This work is personal to me. Is it because of my dad? He was a Navy signalman in World War Two and went to college on the GI Bill. His love for this country was a part of everything he did. And he inspired us -- his five daughters -- to see America through his eyes. </p> <p> Or because of my son Beau? When he joined the Delaware Army National Guard you know I felt the unique pull of both incredible pride and concern that every military mom knows so well. </p> <p> Or perhaps it's because of my grandkids. When Beau served for a year in Iraq I saw how his children navigated his deployment. And I often wondered how people so small could be so strong. </p> <p> Without a doubt being part of this military community has shaped who I am. But that's not why we're here today. We're here because of you the people behind me on these screens; because of the stories that you have shared with me -- your joys and your challenges. </p> <p> From difficult PCSes to the lack of childcare on and off bases; from fighting for your -- to keep your own careers and your identities and to saying goodbye to beloved schools and friends; from caring for your loved ones to mourning those who have been lost -- you are the rudder that steers our military. And supporting your physical social and emotional health is a national security imperative. </p> <p> Every parent knows that when your child is hurting nothing in your world is right. When your spouse is at home trying to make ends meet or torn between taking care of your children and keeping a job your heart breaks with them no matter how far away you are. </p> <p> Our troops love their families with all that they are. Service members cannot be focused on their mission if their families don't have what they need to thrive at home. And we can't expect to keep the best and brightest if our service members are forced to choom [sic] be- -- choose between their love of country and the hopes and dreams they have for their families. </p> <p> We have an all-volunteer force and it continues only because of generations of Americans who see the honor dignity and patriotism of this calling. How can we hope to keep our military strong if we don't give our family survivors and caregivers what they need to survive; if we don't act on our sacred obligation? And that is why we're here today and what Joining Forces is all about. </p> <p> During the Obama-Biden administration we made a lot of progress. And most of all I'm proud that we helped lift up the stories like the ones I heard from those on the screens behind me. And now we're ready to do more. </p> <p> So here's what you're going to see us do over these next few years: We're going to focus on military family employment and entrepreneurship. Before the pandemic the Department of Defense estimated that the military spouse unemployment rate was about 22 percent. </p> <p> Spouses: All of you deserve opportunities to do the work you love whether that means keeping your job when you move from base to base or owning your own businesses. </p> <p> And we need to make sure that you can get quality childcare when you need it so that you don't have to feel like you're choosing between your job and taking care of your kids. </p> <p> We're going to work on education for military children. There are more than 2 million kids whose parents are service members National Guard reservists or veterans. Our schools want to support all students but they don't always know how to do so. We're going to work with educators and our government partners to make sure that you -- our military-connected kids -- have what you need to succeed. </p> <p> And finally we're going to work on military family health and wellbeing. Just 1 percent of our country has shouldered the burden of 20 years of war. No one has more strength and grit and resilience than our military families but you can't do this alone. We have to help you carry this weight by improving access to mental health resources ensuring everyone can put food on the table and supporting caregiving families and survivors. So far we already have commitments from the Departments of Defense Labor and Education. And this is just the beginning. </p> <p> Our effort will take all of our government working together and we expect every agency to step up and be part of it. This is a community bound together by love -- love for our country love for your service members and love for the communities you build together. And it's time that we match that devotion. </p> <p> Your Commander-in-Chief understands that there is no greater honor than serving those who serve our country -- everyone who serves. He's going to make sure that you and your community are seen. And our goal is that this work will live on long after we leave as a permanent priority for every White House because you deserve nothing less. </p> <p> So thank you for all that you do. May God bless our troops and their families. Thank you.</p> <p>  END 11:49 A.M.

""It's that resilience a heart that makes military kids like you so special"" she said.</div> <div> <br> </div> <div> FLOTUS started by recalling the christening ceremony for the USS Gabrielle Giffords and compared that ship to ""the entire armed forces"": ""This ship will be steady in the harshest way strong enough to cut through the most violent seas able to withstand any storm.

I was excited nervous and most of all deeply proud to become an honorary member of the crew’s family—as they say: ""a shipmate for life.”</p> <p> Surrounded by the sounds of shouts and cheers I thought of the brave sailors who would make up her crew—and the families who stood by them. I felt a touch of longing in that celebration—knowing that when the time came to bring this ship to life the spouses and children parents and siblings would stay behind a piece of their hearts would sail away.</p> <p> There’s no ribbon cuttings or showers of champagne to christen their journey—</p> <p> but it is that: a journey through the months apart;happy homecomings and more deployments; andthe transition to life after the military.</p> <p> In that moment that ship seemed to represent our entire armed forces. Anyone could look at its bridge its bow its towering mast and know: this ship will be steady in the harshest winds strong enough to cut through the most violent seas able to withstand any storm. </p> <p> And yet so much of its power is unseen beneath the waves: the engines the anchor</p> <p> the rudders that give it direction and purpose.</p> <p> The families of our service members and veterans; the caregivers who lift up our wounded ill and injured; and the survivors who grieve those we’ve lost – you may not wear a uniform. But you serve and you sacrifice for us all. </p> <p> Military families are as critical to our national defense as a rudder is to a ship.</p> <p> And we must always act upon that truth.</p> <p> ***</p> <p> Today we write the next chapter of a White House initiative that</p> <p> First Lady Michelle Obama and I started 10 years ago: Joining Forces.</p> <p> This work is personal to me.</p> <p> Is it because of my dad?</p> <p> He was a Navy Signalman in World War II and went to college on the GI Bill.</p> <p> His love for this country was a part of everything he did and he inspired us all to see America through his eyes.</p> <p> Or because of my son Beau?</p> <p> When he joined the Delaware Army National Guard I felt the unique pull of both incredible pride and concern that every military mom knows so well.</p> <p> Or perhaps it’s because of my grandkids.</p> <p> When Beau served for a year in Iraq I saw how his children navigated his deployment.</p> <p> I often wondered how people so small could be so strong.</p> <p> Without a doubt being a part of this military community has shaped who I am.</p> <p> But that’s not why we are here today.</p> <p> We’re here because of you—the people behind me on these screens.</p> <p> Because of the stories that you have shared with me your joys and your challenges:</p> <p> from difficult PCSes to the lack of child care on and off bases from fighting to keep your own careers and identities to saying goodbye to beloved schools and friends from caring for your loved ones to mourning those who have been lost ... You are the rudder that steers our military.</p> <p> And supporting your physical social and emotional health is a national security imperative.</p> <p> <b>***</b></p> <p> Every parent knows that when your child is hurting nothing in your world is right. When your spouse is at home trying to make ends meet or torn between taking care of your children and keeping a job your heart breaks with them—no matter how far away you are. </p> <p> Our troops love their families with all that they are. Service members cannot be focused on their mission if their families don’t have what they need to thrive at home.</p> <p> And we can’t expect to keep our best and brightest if our service members are forced to choose between their love of country and the hopes and dreams they have for their families. </p> <p> <a>We have an all-volunteer force—and it continues only because generations of Americans see the honor dignity and patriotism of this calling. How can we hope to keep our military strong if we don’t give our families survivors and caregivers what they need to thrive? If we don’t act on our sacred obligation?</a></p> <p> <a>That is why we’re here today and what Joining Forces is all about.</a></p> <p> ***</p> <p> During the Obama-Biden Administration we made a lot of progress. And most of all I am proud that we helped lift up the stories like the ones I heard from those on the screens behind me. </p> <p> Now we’re ready to do more.</p> <p> So here’s what you’re going to see us do over these next few years:</p> <p> We’re going to focus on military family employment and entrepreneurship.</p> <p> Before the pandemic the Department of Defense estimated that military spouse unemployment rate was around 22 percent.</p> <p> Spouses—all of you—deserve opportunities to do the work you love—whether that means keeping your job when you move from base to base or owning your own business. And we need to make sure you can get quality child care when you need it—so that you don’t have to feel like you’re choosing between your job or taking care of your kids.</p> <p> We’re going to work on education for military children. There are more than 2 million kids whose parents are service members National Guard reservists or veterans. Our schools want to support all students but they don’t always know how to do so. We’re going to work with educators and our government partners to make sure you our military-connected kids have what you need to succeed.</p> <p> And finally we’re going to work on military family health and well-being. Just one percent of our country has shouldered the burden of 20 years of war. No one has more strength grit and resilience than our military families but you can’t do this alone. We have to help you carry this weight—by improving access to mental health resources ensuring everyone can put food on the table and supporting caregiving families and our survivors.</p> <p> And so far we already have commitments from the Departments of Defense Labor and Education. And this is just the beginning. Our effort will take all of our government working together and we expect every agency to step up and be a part of it. </p> <p> <b>***</b></p> <p> This is a community bound together by love—love for their country. Love for your service members. And love for communities you build together. And it’s time we match that devotion. </p> <p> Your Commander in Chief understands that there is no greater honor than serving those who serve our country—everyone who serves. He’s going to make sure that you and your community are seen. And our goal is that this work will live on long after we leave as a permanent priority for every White House.</p> <p> Because you deserve nothing less.</p> <p> Thank you for all that you do.</p> <p> May God bless our troops and their families.</p> <br> </div> <div> <div> <br> </div> <div> <div> <div> <table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <strong>Bricio Segovia</strong></td> </tr> <tr> <td>White House Correspondent | MVS Radio</td> </tr> <tr> <td><br> </td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>M</strong> ▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊</td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong><a href=""http://www.mvsnoticias.com/"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">www.mvsnoticias.com</a><br> <br> <a href=""https://twitter.com/briciosegovia"" title=""https://twitter.com/briciosegovia"">Twitter</a> | <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/briciosegovia"" title=""https://www.instagram.com/briciosegovia""> Instagram</a></strong></td> </tr> </tbody> </table> </div> <div> <table> <tbody> <tr> <td><strong><a href=""http://www.mvsnoticias.com/"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank""></a></strong></td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <br> </div> </div> </div> </div>"

Please tell all your friends tell your aunties and uncles and your grandparents and kid that when it's their turn is their time and let's all just do what we need to do to be healthy to be safe take care of ourselves and our families and in that way we will build back up.”</div><div><br></div><div>VPOTUS then chatted with one man getting his shot Lucio Polanco a 20-year SEIU high-rise window washer receiving the Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine and asked him about his work. Turning to the vaccinator Osman Meah Pharmacy Manager at Jewel Osco she said “How many shots a month do you do — if you had to guess? 12000? No kidding. Wow.”</div><div><br></div><div>There was then a brief speaking program with remarks from Gov. Pritzker Sen. Durbin Sen. Duckworth Rep. Davis and Mayor Lightfoot. Most of it was praise for each other’s work and the work of other people in the room to get vaccines out. There was also much talk of the importance of labor and unions.</div><div><br></div><div>VPOTUS spoke last. </div><div><br></div><div>“So we just celebrated the beginning of spring and depending on your faith or what you believe in or what you think about—Passover and Easter and Ramadan. Whatever your religion or if you don't have a religion this a moment just because of the time of the year. And it's a moment where we feel a sense of renewal. We see the buds on the trees we see the flowers starting to bloom the days are longer it’s starting to get warm. And we can see a light at the end of the tunnel. Because we've been going through so much so much death. So much loss: loss of life loss of jobs loss of normalcy for our children loss of very critical stages of their education. And a lot of folks also were isolated because we said that's what we have to do. You can’t hang out with your friends. You might have to be alone at home. And you know when people are isolated it tends to make this feel alone like it's just us.”</div><div><br></div><div>She talked about collective work and how organized labor is built on that sense of collective need and collective effort. Then moving into recounting her trip to the water treatment plant in Oakland yesterday and repeating a line that she thinks wars will soon be fought over water the way they were fought over oil she said “The jobs to build up the water infrastructure that I was looking at yesterday—that’s plumbers that’s pipe fitters electricians. That's what's going to build back up our infrastructure. We're talking about human infrastructure. Well Kamala what’s that about? Human infrastructure. If you've got children or elderly relatives you can't go to work if you don't have somebody who’s got b to take care of them. That's called human infrastructure.”</div><div><p>The VP’s office sends along this background:</p><p>Today Vice President Harris is traveling to Chicago. She will be participating in a walking tour of the International Union of Operating Engineers Local 399 union hall which currently serves as a COVID-19 vaccination site.

body-095,Please check remarks with official transcript. <div><br></div><div>Surgeon General: </div><div>Good morning everyone so much for joining us today. To serve as a surgeon in my role I'm charged with looking out for the health and well being of each and every American. I consider this to be as a sacred responsibility particularly in this great moment. When we're living through a once in a century. I knew we're here because we all know that COVID-19 has caused tremendous suffering for millions of Americans many of us have lost family members to this virus. I myself have lost seven including my uncle Roman earlier this year. Many of us have also felt what it's like to be worried about your loved ones getting killed especially family members of ours who are elderly or who might work on the frontlines. And over this past year. My father and my sister went to work in their medical practice. I couldn't help but hear that this was the day that they were going to be exposed to the virus. And during the academic. People have also lost many other jobs the chance to go to school the possibility of holding back on the fact that this pandemic is also affected. Some people are more than others. It's also underscored that profound racial and geographic disparities in health that have long plagued our nation. But despite the heavy toll of COVID as exactly this pandemic has also reminded us of a fundamental truth that we need each other and our happiness and our survival depends on our connection to one another and our community. And during this past year even as COVID separated as physically. So many people stepped up to help one another delivering food to neighbors who were too worried to go to the grocery store Checking in on friends who are having a hard time putting their own lives at risk provide medical care and hospitals to get grocery stores open and to keep our neighborhoods safe. That spirit of community is what makes our country great. And it is what we need now more than as far as we seek the brand is pandemics and we're all here today because all of you have to greet the founding members of the COVID-19 community in nationwide grassroots network of leaders who are stepping up to protect your communities and to get our our goal is to help our communities get vaccinated and by doing so to stop this spread. Now I know that we've made great progress on the vaccination front. And even though nearly 100 million Americans have already received at least one shot there are still millions of Americans are not protected against the virus. Your leadership has the power to change them collectively you can reach out to millions of people with the facts about COVID and a COVID vaccine. And this is so important because hearing the facts from trusted sources. This will help people make good decisions about their health. And that's why I firmly believe that your involvement will stabilize. And it's why all of us are so grateful to you for being easy for you. As we begin our conversation today. And as we embark on this work together. I'm also reminded that this initiative is made possible by the hard working men in the administration we're committed to addressing COVID With the power of science and compassion and partnership that commitment starts at the very tough. Having champions in the White House with public health is absolutely essential. And that is why I'm so honored to introduce one of our nation's most important leaders. One who is broken barriers and lifted up communities a leader who is kind and strong and who is inspired millions of people including myself and a daughter who took the climb or covered it in the very first time they saw her.</div>

body-253,"<div> <div>POTUS FLOTUS newly confirmed grandson Hunter and extended Biden family left church at 2:08 pm walking into the beautiful spring sunshine. They spent some minutes outside the doors for photos and chatting. Jill Biden then walked to her SUV and re-emerged with a bouquet of flowers that she took to the other side of the church where the Biden family graves including that of Beau are located. During this time the president stayed with the group of friends/relatives talking. Frequent laughter drifted across the grassy church yard. At 2:17 pm the president and that main group strolled to the other side of the church presumably joining FLOTUS although pool was no longer able to witness anything.</div> <br> <br> <div> <table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><b>Sebastian Smith</b></p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p><i>White House correspondent</i></p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td>@SebastianAFP</td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p>Tel: <a href=""tel:▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊"">▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊</a> - Mob: <a href=""tel:▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊"">▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊</a></p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><img alt=""Agence France-Presse"" height=""40"" src=""http://signature.afp.com/logo/LogoAFP.png""></p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> Sent from my iPhone</div> </div>"

This is 88% of all adults and 88% of all children in the state.</li><li> Additional relief of up to $1600 per child through the Child Tax Credit to the families of 2274000 children lifting 171000 children out of poverty.</li><li> Additional relief of up to nearly $1000 through the Earned Income Tax Credit to 572000 childless workers.</li><li> Marketplace health insurance premiums that are $1406 lower per month for a 60-year old couple earning $75000 per year. </li></ul> <p> <b><u>The Need for the American Jobs Plan in Georgia</u></b></p> <p> <a>Georgia’s infrastructure received a C+ grade on its Infrastructure Report Card. The American Jobs Plan (AJP) will make historic investments in our nation’s infrastructure:</a></p> <ul> <li> <b>Roads and bridges:</b> In Georgia there are 374 bridges and over 2260 miles of highway in poor condition. Since 2011 commute times have increased by 10.8% and on average each driver pays $375 per year in costs due to driving on roads in need of repair. The AJP will devote more than $600 billion to transportation infrastructure including $115 billion for repairing roads and bridges.</li><li> <b>Public Transportation</b>: Georgians who take public transportation spend an extra 74.1% of their time commuting and non-White households are 3.9 times more likely to commute via public transportation. The AJP will modernize public transit with an $85 billion investment.</li><li> <b>Resilient Infrastructure</b>: From 2010 to 2020 Georgia has experienced 46 extreme weather events costing the state up to $20 billion in damages. The AJP invests $50 billion to improve the resiliency of our infrastructure and support communities’ recovery. </li><li> <b>Drinking Water</b>: Over the next 20 years Georgia’s drinking water infrastructure will require $12.5 billion in additional funding. The AJP includes a $111 billion investment to ensure safe drinking water. </li><li> <b>Housing</b>: In part due to a lack of available and affordable housing 654000 renters in Georgia are rent burdened meaning they spend more than 30% of their income on rent. The AJP invests over $200 billion to increase housing supply and support affordable housing. </li><li> <b>Broadband</b>: 10% of Georgians live in areas where there is no broadband infrastructure that provides minimally acceptable speeds. 15% of Georgia households do not have an internet subscription. The AJP will invest $100 billion to bring universal reliable high-speed and affordable coverage to every family in America.</li><li> <b>Caregiving</b>: Across the country hundreds of thousands of older adults and people with disabilities need home and community-based services. The AJP will invest $400 billion to help more people access care and improve the quality of caregiving jobs. </li><li> <b>Child Care</b>: In Georgia 44% of residents live in a childcare desert. The AJP will modernize our nation’s schools and early learning facilities and build new ones in neighborhoods across Georgia.</li><li> <b>Manufacturing</b>: Manufacturers account for more than 10% of total output in Georgia employing 411000 workers or 8.9% of the state’s workforce. The AJP will invest $300 billion to retool and revitalize American manufacturers. </li><li> <b>Home energy</b>: In Georgia an average low-income family spends 10-12% of their income on energy costs forcing tough choices between paying energy bills and buying food or other essentials. The AJP will support upgrades to make low-income homes more energy efficient.</li><li> <b>Clean energy jobs</b>: As of 2019 there were 83806 Georgians working in clean energy and the AJP invests in creating more well- paying union jobs advancing clean energy production by extending and expanding tax credits for clean energy generation carbon capture and sequestration and clean energy manufacturing.</li><li> <b>Veterans Health</b>: Georgia is home to over 697127 veterans (12.7% are women and 38% are 65+). The AJP invests $18 billion to improve the infrastructure of VA health care facilities.</li></ul> <p> <b><u>The Need for the American Families Plan:</u></b></p> <p> The AFP will directly invest in Georgians to strengthen our schools expand access to good paying jobs and support our workers to once again build a middle-class that carries our nation forward. </p> <ul> <li> <b>Higher Education: </b>The average cost of a 2-year degree in Georgia is almost $4100 per year. High costs are partly why just 61% of students in Georgia are able to complete a postsecondary degree within 6 years of enrolling. The AFP will <a>provide at least two years of free community college to all students including DREAMers. It will also increase the maximum Pell Grant awards by $1400 to support the 220000 students in Georgia who rely on Pell. In addition the AFP will support Georgia’s 38 Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) Tribal Colleges and Universities (TCUs) and Minority-Serving Institutions (MSIs)</a>.</li><li> <b>Universal Pre-school: </b>Only 30% of the 296000 3- and 4-year-olds in Georgia have access to publicly-funded pre-school. The AFP will <a>provide access to free high-quality pre-school to all 3- and 4-year-olds in Georgia</a>. In addition the AFP will <a>ensure that all employees in funded pre-school programs are paid a $15 minimum wage</a>.</li><li> <b>Investing in teachers: </b>Having teachers reflect the communities they serve is critical to student performance and in Georgia just 31% of teachers are teachers of color while students of color make up 61% of the student population. The AFP will invest $9 billion to address teacher shortages improve teacher preparation recruit and develop more teachers of color.</li><li> <b>Child nutrition: </b>14% of children in Georgia live in food insecure households and 31% are obese. The AFP will expand access to free school meals to an additional 159000 students and provide 1.1 million students ways to purchase food during summer.</li><li> <b>Child care: </b>The average annual cost of childcare for a toddler or infant in Georgia is over $8100 meaning the average family spends 9% of their income on child care every year. The lack of affordable childcare also makes it more difficult for women to work contributing to the 19% gap in workforce participation between mothers and fathers. The AFP <a>will enable low and middle-income families to pay no more than 7% of their income on high-quality child care</a>. </li><li> <b>Paid leave: </b>More than 30 million workers in 41 states including Georgia lack access to paid sick leave. The AFP will create a national comprehensive paid family and medical leave program.</li><li> <b>Health care:</b> The ARP provides two years of lower health insurance premiums for those who buy coverage on their own; the AFP will make those premium reductions permanent. In Georgia that means 193000 uninsured people will gain coverage and 262000 will save hundreds of dollars per year on their premiums. The average family in Georgia will save $50 per person per month on health coverage. </li><li> <a><b>Tax cuts for families and workers: </b></a> <ul> <li>The AFP will extend through 2025 the Child Tax Credit increases of $3000 per child 6-years-old and above and $3600 per child under 6 that were enacted in the ARP. It will make the credit fully refundable so that low-income families receive the same credit as middle-income families. This extension will benefit more than 91% of children in Georgia more than 1.3 million of whom are children of color and is estimated to lift 171000 children out of poverty in the state.</li><li>To support families with childcare needs the AFP will provide a permanent increase to the temporary Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit expansion enacted in the ARP. Families will get back as a tax credit as much as half of their spending on child care for children under age 13.</li><li>The American Families Plan will also make the Earned Income Tax Credit Expansion for childless workers permanent to support low-wage workers. This will benefit 569000 workers in Georgia many of whom are essential workers and 289000 of whom are people of color.</li></ul> </li></ul> <p> <b><u>Federal Support for </u></b><b><u>Georgia</u></b><b><u> Vaccinations</u></b></p> <p> <b>Pharmacies: </b>As of April 27 through the federal program the Biden-Harris Administration has made vaccines available in nearly 1200 pharmacies to date with over 600 receiving deliveries in the past week. Participating retail pharmacies are primarily Walgreens Kroger CVS and Walmart locations.</p> <p> <b>Community Health Centers: </b>The Biden-Harris Administration has invited all 35 health centers in Georgia to receive direct vaccine allocations spanning 26 cities. Combined the centers have sites at over 250 different care delivery locations across the state. As of April 27 16970 doses have been delivered to Community Health Centers in Georgia through the federal vaccinations program.</p> <p> <b>Federal Funding:</b> As of April 26 the Biden-Harris Administration has provided over $116 million to the state to support vaccination operations. There are 9 community vaccination centers operational in the state including one FEMA pilot CVC at the Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta. 270 federal personnel are currently deployed to the state to support vaccination efforts in addition to more than 1000 federally-funded National Guard members supporting the state’s COVID-19 response.</p> <div>Get <a href=""https://aka.ms/o0ukef""> Outlook for iOS</a></div> </div> </div> <br> <p><b>Disclaimer</b></p> <p>This e-mail and any attached files are intended for the named addressee only.

body-056,<p>VPOTUS and Governor Newsom were given a tour of the water treatment facility. For the first part of the tour their conversation with David Briggs Director of Operations and Maintenance EBMUD who was conducting the tour was not audible over the water moving at the treatment plant. <br><br>It’s pretty much exactly what you’d expect of a water treatment plant - asphalt cement pipes water.<br><br>“Maybe because I’m a kid from California” VPOTUS said she thinks more about drought and water policy. She asked two people who’ve worked as apprentices at the facility to tell her about how their work helps address that. They discussed how they have helped provide water to fight wildfires. The governor asked how they’ve adapted to dealing with power outages. Harris said she’d be telling their stories including that they are members of a union all around the country. The VP’s office identified the apprentices as Nalani Heath-Delaney Carpenter EBMUD and Walter Coty Construction Inspector EBMUD.<br><br>Speaking with Angela Glover Blackwell founder of PolicyLink later in the tour she spoke about human infrastructure in addition to physical infrastructure: “it’s also about building up the skill set of America’s workers.” For example she said “that literally is part of the infrastructure of any working family - the caregivers” she said. “It’s all connected.”<br><br>But then she started talking about equity issues around water treatment and shaking her arms in the air to show excitement jokingly apologized to Newsom: “I’m just going to continue to geek out on water.”<br><br>She addressed the pool at the end starting by saying she was glad to be home in Oakland.<br><br>“We must understand the equities and inequities of distribution and access to clean water especially clean drinking water and address it in a way that is about supporting what governments must do at a local at a state and federal level understanding the opportunities here and this is a big part of the American Jobs Plan which is the opportunity to not only build back up our infrastructure around water and water policy .... part of our reason for being here to advance is the issue of water equity whether you're talking about Iowa where I spent a lot of time and places in the Midwest where people have wells in their backyard and sewage systems on their property. It is on their property it is there but it is eroding and they don't have the resources to actually upgrade and make it safe. And so part of our policy is to say give grants give support to homeowners to be able to upgrade their systems because of course this is a public health issue. We are looking at it in terms of places like Flint the Mississippi Delta.” She spoke about the need for more union jobs and for lead pipes to be replaced to stop water contamination and the health effects of lead in water.<br><br>In comments that will be relevant to a governor facing a recall she turned to Newsom and said “I especially want to thank you Governor. He and I have worked together for a long time we were elected to our first office same time. Back in 2003 and one of the things I know is that Gavin has always been a champion about what we need to do around our environment and he and I have had many conversations over the years in particular about preservation of water. And so I'm just so happy that you've been able to join us governor.”<br><br>Newsom started by saying “you don't need to educate the Vice President on water policy and what a gift that is for us particularly out here in the state of California.” He spoke about the well below average results of the annual snowpack survey and the water shortages likely to come. Referring to the administration’s infrastructure proposal he said “I know we're prone to hyperbole it's a game changer to complement the efforts that are happening at the local level to address the needs here in the East Bay system that was designed in the 1930s that needs investment needs upgrade.”<br><br>Rolling to the next stop at 11:18.<br><br><br><br><br>——<br>Edward-Isaac Dovere<br>The Atlantic<br>@IsaacDovere<br><br><br></p>

body-094,Please check remarks with official transcript.<div><br></div><div>I just have to tell you he has been tireless for months and months working on this issue and so in front of everyone. I want to thank you is that for all you have been doing to lift us up as a nation and to also lift up the importance of following the signs and the cast that we are in together. And so lifting up the power and significance of the collective. And so to everyone. Thank you. Good morning I know it's very early for all of the friends on the West Coast and to all of you thank you for for joining this first meeting this inaugural meeting of our community core and we are truly very excited about the participation and the collaboration and coalition building potential of this group of leaders and I'll tell you when we look at the number of vaccines that are being administered each week. They are increasing and that gives us a sense of optimism. We are breaking records all the time our goal is 100 million shots movie Days is now 200 million shots in 100 days and by April 19 Nine in 10 adults in the United States will be eligible to sign up for a shot. And we want and the President was very strong. Didn't want every adult in the United States to sign up and get vaccinated when they can and when it's their turn because that's what we're. And that's what will make us healthy and get us through this pandemic. And so this is what we're here to discuss and again thank you all for for taking the call to be part of this around this virtual table. We have some of the most trusted leaders in the United States. I've got a big screen here where I can see everyone. I hope you all can see each other. We can live away political action we have community leaders we have faith leaders we have union leaders we have business leaders leaders leaders leaders and and we know that the people of our country look to leaders like you and they have been looking to you they've been looking in your eyes searching to believe that there should be a reason to have hope. They have been looking in your eyes and looking to you to give us some confidence that we can get through this and give her a sense of knowing that they are not alone this is what you have been doing over the course of this last year. And you of course are leaders that are leaders in your communities you work with people with folks on the ground and have a history.</div><div><br></div><div>And when people are then making a decision to get vaccinated. They're going to look to you. They're going to look to you to help answer the questions that they may not that may what's in the vaccine and may also include how do I sign up. How do I get there the transportation piece. And so that's why today as part of our broader public education campaign. We are launching our COVID-19 community core. And so everyone as the Surgeon General has said everyone gathered here is a founding member and I thank you on behalf of myself and President Biden stepping up.<br></div><div><br></div><div>This is a really important moment. And we have a great opportunity at this moment as we all know each day is not equal. We are at a stage where with the increasing number of supply of vaccinations. We are at a face. At this moment where we can actually get a hold of this thing and advance.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Protecting our neighbors. And so as members you will have access to the latest information and posted resources that you can then share with those who serve and we will work with you to get created and we want your ideas about how we can be most creative to be most effective. Through our share them like program for instance we can set up a q&amp;a a question and answer with a doctor or a nurse on your platforms. This work couldn't be more important than ask me know our public health professionals are some of the most trusted in terms of a source of information about what is in the vaccine and how it works.<br></div><div><br></div><div>But here's the other truth that we must speak in some communities some of our hardest hit communities. It's too hard to access the vaccine or give information about it. and we have to be honest about that we've certainly we have to be honest that in some communities there was a concern about your the vaccinated. Some based on mistrust based on history. Some based on just rooted in the misinformation of which there's a lot out there and we need your help to combat that.<br></div><div><br></div><div>And simply these are the these are some of the concerns that people have and these are these are fair concerns which we must address.<br></div><div><br></div><div>But no matter the community trusted leaders are the best way to produce competence and trusted leaders you are the best way to deliver information you know yesterday I actually convened a group of faith leaders from around the country and they were very clear they said look sometimes people just need basic information you know I mean you're asking people to take a shot in the arm they need they need to know what's going on. They need to know things like what's in the vaccine how does it work.<br></div><div><br></div><div>And they need to hear from the people they trust and again that is you. And so that's why we are investing the bulk of our time and resources in this group of leaders and you.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Who are the trusted Leaders of America. Last week we announced that we're investing nearly $10 billion in grants to community organizations to help centers and local governments to help build confidence and increase access to the vaccine. And with our community core. We will empower more leaders with more information to reach more people. So you kind of get the theme here we need to do more. And we need your help to do it whether you run a face to face organization that's going door to door to schedule appointments and so many of you've been doing or food assistance program that's making sure that folks have transportation to vaccination sites or community health centers doing the beautiful culturally competent work of bilingual health outreach speaking to people in the language they speak Literally and cultural and the basic message of course we all know is pretty straightforward. The vaccine is safe and it will say the vaccine is safe. And it was safe.<br></div><div><br></div><div>And so the community core is about getting that message out as far and as wide as we possibly can. And you know I've been calling our broad public education campaign. So we can do this campaign because I do believe I know that we can do this. And so with your help let's do that. And I look forward to hearing from you about what you were doing how it is going how we might help you scale your good work. And again you know this has been a moment of great crisis as our Surgeon General has said weight loss loss of life loss Jobs was the normal city for our children loss of very significant basis of their educational process. And there is why we are now.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Spring guaranteed see the cherry blossoms blooming.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Around the world regardless of your state or where you might be this is a time where we celebrate renewal and hope.<br></div><div><br></div><div>And I'm very much feeling that and I know we are collectively feeling that but we have to couple our hopes and our faith with action because that's the only way we will achieve all that we hope to achieve in game. And so that again brings me back to you because you are people of action. And we are so honored to have you join us. And so now we're going to hear from several of our community core founding members. And the first is I'm introducing Dr. Reed Texas of the black Coalition Against COVID Dr. Thompson.<br><div><br></div><div><b>Vice President Harris spoke with Dr. Reed Tuckson of the Black Coalition Against COVID; Neil Bradley Executive Vice President and Chief Policy Officer at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce; Mary Kay Henry SEUI President; Zippy Duval American Farm Bureau Federation President; and Hyepin I’m Faith and Community Empowerment President/CEO &amp; Founder.</b></div><div><i><br></i></div><div><i>She offered the following remarks based on topic in response to the speakers listed above. </i></div><div><br></div><div>Black vaccine information:</div><div><br></div><div> what is what is also clear to me about this moment of crisis is that there is the opportunity to reintroduce and remind folks of what is available to them in their community by way of public health assistance and healthcare. And we should think about this that way because it is about first and immediately and like you said April is a critical month so it is immediately about the vaccines but it can also be a conversation that reminds folks of what is available to them in their community health centers in their in their community based organizations to get them access to health care for all of the other needs that they have and so that's where I see a great opportunity again this is a moment where this crisis gives me hope that we can potentially leapfrog over the COVID issue into a place where we also accelerate giving people access to the overall health care they need. And in many ways I think that this pandemic has been an accelerator for those for whom things were bad before they even worse now. But if we can see it as also an opportunity to accelerate into a better place than we were even before. Our work will be worth it. I think it's the it's the leap frogging concept it's also building the bridge you're creating is. It's funny because this is what you and the President are doing with building an infrastructure. That's right and that if we build it right and we build it with an eye to the future then we lose what we built in the pandemic.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Paid sick leave:</div><div><br></div><div> to all of those business leaders who have stepped up to a particular offer paid sick leave so that their employees on the back end because we don't want our workforce to have to choose between earning the money that they need to pay their kids when and getting a vaccine. So thank you and please pass on our thanks to your members.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Essential workers:</div><div><br></div><div>Thank you to your members those essential workers who from the beginning of this pandemic were going to work off of taking public transportation. Without the equipment that they needed to be to be sure that they could be safe but out of their commitment to caring for strangers often. They kept going to work exposing themselves and their family to harm but their commitment to the health and well being of our country it has been extraordinary. And so please on behalf of all of us.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Food insecurity:</div><div><br></div><div>There's been so much food and security around our country and our American farmers have been stepping up in extraordinary ways you know to the extent that I've been able to travel in the midst of COVID I've been so many distribution centers and what our American farmers have been doing. Just just not only great just about being out there and continuing to to grow the food supply in our country but what they've been doing in terms of the donations they've been making has really been extraordinary because while they are trying to make it through the month they've been so generous and I'll just take a moment of privilege to also just share with everyone. I went to one food distribution center. And the folks who were working there told me that you know people will line up in their cars for hours waiting to get to the point where they can receive the donation and what they were finding the volunteers were finding is this a car would pull up and then because of COVID there's no physical interaction between the volunteer and the occupant of the car but the occupant of the car they'll pop up in their trunk and the volunteers were finding often that when the trunk open there'll be a piece of paper there with him arriving with the occupants of the car wrote notes to the volunteers to thank them from time to time the trunk will pop open. And there might be a new and a $5 bill the occupants of the car who are in a food line stretched to the limits but still want to give back something. And at the very least honor the dignity of the work of the volunteers and the end farmers and everyone who has contributed to that. There's so much about this pandemic and the crisis that has also shown. The grace you know and and and what what the beauty of the strength of human beings and and what I believe is our fundamental nature to be kind and to be thankful and to be a community. So thank you and gives me thank you for any new members from.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Anti-Asian Hate:</div><div><br></div><div>rience that far too many of our Asian brothers and sisters have been having you know we sort of the beginning of this conversation Dr Tuckson has a campaign saying make it plain. That means also in my opinion a minute real and speaking truth. Yeah and I appreciate you making that point and I think we all know as a collective as a coalition as a community and as a country we all need to speak out against the hate where we are seeing it and we need to remind our fellow human beings that they are not alone and we will stand together wherever and whenever we see that kind of hate being expressed. <br></div><div><br></div><div>Racial Inequalities:</div><div><br></div><div>It is very important to the President that we speak truth and address racial inequities. Across the board but on this topic in particular in our healthcare system and again these disparities existed long before when we look at the rates of the infection and death agents in the next American Latinos lives our native community. the numbers are really unacceptable and tragic and in terms of the impact on these communities of course profound and so this is something we have been addressing that we have a racial equity task force that is very much a part of our whole approach to this. And in addition you will often hear the president and all of us talk about the importance of equitable distribution of resources and support.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Handing off pool duty.</div><div><br></div></div><br>

body-522,"<div>The roundtable kicked off at<a href=""#""> 12:47pm</a> and ended at 1:33pm. VP Harris took five questions from the pool before exiting the room at 1:38pm.

I’ll send out her answers shortly — nothing groundbreaking.  <div> <div> <div> <br> </div> <div> Some color from the roundtable: </div> <div> <br> </div> <div> It began with Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) saying VP Harris “has made such a difference as vice president already.” Harris said of Brown “Whether the cameras are on or off he is the same person.”</div> <div> <br> </div> <div> The event featured Sen. Brown moderating a discussion between VP Harris and five participants. Everyone sat masked around a table inside the 1819 Innovation Hub at the University of Cincinnati.</div> <div> <br> </div> <div> VP Harris said she views public transit in the context of “Let’s just start with making it doable. Can they raise their families? Get to work? Get to the grocery store?” She said the American Jobs Plan would allocate $110 billion for transit agencies to build on “what you’re doing here in Cincinnati.” VP Harris also said investing in public transit will help fight climate change.</div> <div> <br> </div> <div> Some quotes/notes from the roundtable participants:</div> <ul> <li> Darryl Haley SORTA CEO said “Public transit is about connection...it’s also about connecting to higher paying jobs.”</li><li> Jill Meyer Cincinnati Regional Chamber of Commerce: “When people can make choices we know that they can access better jobs.” She said $1 spent on transit = $3 in economic impact. “Where transit is accessible is where development happens.” </li><li> Eddie Koen Urban League encouraged the Biden/Harris Administration to “really think about transit from a racial equity lens” and build on what they’re already doing.</li><li> Troy Miller Amalgamated Transit Union Local 627 said a lot of his members contracted COVID while working but they’ve recently been using city busses to get members vaccinated. </li><li> Vikas Mehta University of Cincinnati said transit “is social it is psychological.” He talked about the importance of accessibility to bus stops for families and improving infrastructure like sidewalks so people can get around safely. </li></ul> <div> VP Harris said the American Jobs Plan has “substantial money set aside for training” workers to adapt to clean energy transit jobs. She added that organized labor will be key in facilitating the training.</div> <div> <br> </div> <div> Asked by Sen. Brown why people who don’t rely on public transportation should care about investing in it SORTA CEO Darryl Haley said “Even if you yourself don’t use public transportation the people you count on count on public transportation.”</div> <div> <br> </div> <div> VP Harris closed by saying it was an “insightful conversation” about infrastructure which she called a “fancy word for how do you get to where you need to go?” </div> <br> <div> <div>Taylor Popielarz</div> <div>Spectrum News Washington Reporter</div> <div>▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊▊</div> <div>@TaylorPopielarz</div> <div><br> </div> Sent from my iPhone</div> </div> </div> </div> The contents of this e-mail message and <br>any attachments are intended solely for the <br>addressee(s) and may contain confidential <br>and/or legally privileged information.

body-328,"<div><div><div><div>VPOTUS spoke at 12:10 p.m. for about eight minutes beginning by praising Sen. Hassan as an advocate for universal broadband access. <br><br>No major news but highlights are below.<br><br>VPOTUS compared the push for universal broadband to congressional action in 1936 to fund nationwide electrification: ""The idea was pretty basic: Not everybody in America had electricity. And it was really clear that without electricity you couldn't function. You couldn't participate at an equal level. You couldn't be competitive. The quality of life would be so compromised. And so we said as a country: 'Hey! No this is everybody in it together. We all have to participate in making sure everyone has the basic services that are necessary to raise their families participate in society and be productive.'""<br><br>She laughed: ""Many of us grew up with -- you know we had to do our homework and if you needed help you went to the Encyclopedia Brittanica. Those days are over! Now you've got to have access to the Internet!""<br><br>She spoke briefly but mostly inaudibly in the face of a stiff wind about broadband's impact on small business. Your pooler caught the words ""access and affordability."" <br><br>""Think about our seniors. The pandemic made so clear that some of our most vulnerable those that need healthcare the most can't get to a doctor. But we have this thing called telemedicine where you can get diagnosed you can get treatment -- *if*if you have access to broadband.""<br><br>VPOTUS said massive amounts of money are being spent to bring ""affordable access to broadband to everyone. It's the same thing that our country decided to do in 1936 saying 'Let's get electricity to everybody.' And rural America should not be left out of that priority."" ...<br><br>""the emphasis on co-ops the emphasis on nonprofits the emphasis on efforts that are being led by the community. And so that's why we're here today: To see it. To see it and understand. This is really an incredible moment in our history.""<br><br>VPOTUS turned to the racks of transformers and asked Steve Camerino: ""What are we looking at?"" Camerino told her they were electric transformers and fiber optic cables.<br><br>VPOTUS went back to Jeff Bird for a minute-long conversation even quieter than before and closer to him. Nothing was audible. She chatted with Camerino and then walked back inside the Co-op building for a meet-and-greet listening session that is closed to the press.</div><div><br></div><div>VPOTUS took no questions from reporters. We have yet to get face-time or a gaggle today.<br><br>Your pooler is sending this dispatch from inside the parked pool van where VP staff was kind enough to bring some pizza. Our van driver spotted a bald eagle circling overhead.<br><br>When VPOTUS wraps up inside we'll be on the road again headed toward Concord N.H. for an event at an apprenticeship training center run by the International Brotherhood of Electric Workers.

Teresa Leger Fernanez was wearing a turquoise shiny jacket with a gold pattern and a brightly colored pink mask that looked like a Mexican weaving. </div> <div> <br> </div> <div> She said the jacket was made by an Indigenous designer to mimic a pottery design and the mask was a reflection of her Latina heritage. </div> <div> <br> </div> <div> <u>Re: the jacket</u></div> <div> <br> </div> <div> I'm the chair of the Committee on Indigenous People and she's going out to a Native American reservation and what we know is that we are going to look at structural racism and addressing those inequities the communities that are most is Native Americans they are the most we have failed in that process. I wanted to bring this to honor you know the fact that she's going there.  <br> </div> <div> <p><br> </p></div> <div> <p><u>The mask</u></p></div> <div> <p> The mask is I'm also Latina and so I wanted to make sure we highlighted the fact that you know I met with the president yesterday with the Congressional Hispanic Caucus met with the president and vice president and they were so committed to addressing systemic racial inequity. And they understand the issues around the Latino community because this is my identity. It's like honoring you know I'm Latina. I work for Native American tribes that she's on their land right now. </p> <p> <u>The airport is on indigenous land</u></p> <p> This airport we always say in New Mexico we often recognize the fact that these are lands that were originally had by Indigenous people. And then in New Mexico there has been such a you know the Spanish community intermarriages. I myself am a little bit of everything. I'm a 17th generation New Mexican. So I have a little bit of everything in me. </p> <p> <u>What her trip means</u></p> <p> And it means a lot to have her come because it's a recognition that all of these communities matter and that rural communities matter the fact that she's going out to a rural community. Also I want everybody to know what the American rescue plan is doing. So it's doing everything from the shots in the arms to what it's going to doing in the rural community and on Navajo land. And that I think is key is we need to keep reminding us this is the work we're doing. </p> <p> I'm glad to be here because Congress passed the American rescue plan. We are working on the American family plan and the jobs plan because without that we don't come out of this not just build back better but for some places it's never been built. Like for some places on the Navajo reservation it's not building back better it's building it for the first time. So that's what we really need to get done. And by her coming and bringing that attention. I mean nobody else can do that. And she's bringing that attention to it. </p> <p> <u>Praise for her love of education</u></p> <p> And then her love of education. I'm daughter of educators ...
